  Abstract                 = {A linear model is suggested for the influence of covariates on the intensity function. This approach is less vulnerable than the Cox model to problems of inconsistency when covariates are deleted or the precision of covariate measurements is changed. A method of non-parametric estimation of regression functions is presented. This results in plots that may give information on the change over time in the influence of covariates. A test method and two goodness of fit plots are also given. The approach is illustrated by simulation as well as by data from a clinical trial of treatment of carcinoma of the oropharynx.},

  Abstract                 = {Upper gastrointestinal ({GI)} cancers of the stomach and esophagus have high incidence and mortality worldwide, but they are uncommon in Western countries. Little information exists on the association between vitamin D and risk of upper {GI} cancers. This study examined the association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25({OH)D)} and upper {GI} cancer risk in the Cohort Consortium Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers. Concentrations of 25({OH)D} were measured from 1,065 upper {GI} cancer cases and 1,066 age-, sex-, race-, and season-of blood draw–matched controls from 8 prospective cohort studies. In multivariate-adjusted models, circulating 25({OH)D} concentration was not significantly associated with upper {GI} cancer risk. Subgroup analysis by race showed that among Asians, but not Caucasians, lower concentrations of 25({OH)D} ({\textless}25 {nmol/L)} were associated with a statistically significant decreased risk of upper {GI} cancer (reference: 50–{\textless}75 {nmol/L)} (odds ratio = 0.53, 95\% confidence interval: 0.31, 0.91; P trend = 0.003). Never smokers with concentrations of {\textless}25 {nmol/L} showed a lower risk of upper {GI} cancers (odds ratio = 0.55, 95\% confidence interval: 0.31, 0.96). Subgroup analyses by alcohol consumption produced opposing trends. Results do not support the hypothesis that interventions aimed at increasing vitamin D status would lead to a lower risk of these highly fatal cancers.},

  Abstract                 = {{BACKGROUND:} Tobacco smoke chemicals may influence vitamin D metabolism and function, and conversely vitamin D may modify the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke chemicals. We tested the hypothesis that lower plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25({OH)D]} is associated with a higher risk of tobacco-related cancer in the general population. {METHODS:} A prospective population-based cohort of 9791 individuals from the Copenhagen City Heart Study who were free of cancer at baseline was followed from 1981–1983 until December 2008 with 100\% complete follow-up. {RESULTS:} During up to 28 years of follow-up, 1081 participants developed a tobacco-related cancer and 1506 developed other cancers. Decreasing 25({OH)D} concentrations, subdivided by clinical categories or by seasonally adjusted percentile categories, were associated with increasing cumulative incidence of tobacco-related cancer (log-rank trend P = 2 × 10−6 and P = 5 × 10−9). Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios of tobacco-related cancer were 1.75 (95\% {CI}, 1.33–2.30) for 25({OH)D} {\textless}5 vs ≥20 {ng/mL}, and 2.07 (1.63–2.62) for ≤5th vs {\textgreater}66th percentile. Also, multivariable adjusted hazard ratios for a 50\% reduction in 25({OH)D} were 1.20 (1.13–1.28) for any tobacco-related cancer, 1.19 (95\% {CI}, 1.09–1.31) for lung cancer, 1.44 (1.19–1.73) for head and neck cancer, 1.28 (1.06–1.54) for bladder cancer, 1.34 (1.04–1.73) for kidney cancer, and 0.95 (0.89–1.01) for other cancers. {CONCLUSIONS:} Lower plasma 25({OH)D} was associated with higher risk of tobacco-related cancers, but not with risk of other cancers.},

  Abstract                 = {Sun exposure is a major risk factor for skin cancer and is also an important source of vitamin D. We tested the hypothesis that elevated plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-{OH-vitD)} associates with increased risk of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer in the general population. We measured plasma 25-{OH-vitD} in 10,060 white individuals from the Danish general population. During 28 years of follow-up, 590 individuals developed non-melanoma skin cancer and 78 developed melanoma skin cancer. Increasing 25-{OH-vitD} levels, by clinical categories or by seasonally adjusted tertiles, were associated with increasing cumulative incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (trend P=2 × 10−15 and P=3 × 10−17) and melanoma skin cancer (P=0.003 and P=0.001). Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios of non-melanoma skin cancer were 5.04 (95\% confidence interval ({CI):} 2.78–9.16) for 25-{OH-vitD} 50 vs. {\textless}25 nmol l−1, and 4.02 (2.45–6.60) for top versus bottom tertile. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios of melanoma skin cancer were 4.7 (0.96–23.3) for 25-{OH-vitD} 50 vs. {\textless}25 nmol l−1, and 6.3 (1.38–28.8) for top versus bottom tertile. The absolute 20-year risk was 11\% for non-melanoma skin cancer and 1.5\% for melanoma skin cancer, in participants with age {\textgreater}60 years, 25-{OH-vitD} winter levels 50 nmol l−1, and performing outdoor exercise. In conclusion, we show that increasing levels of 25-{OH-vitD} are associated with increased risk of non-melanoma and melanoma skin cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {{OBJECTIVES:} The aim was to evaluate the association between serum vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) level and risk of prostate cancer. {METHODS:} The nested case-control study was based on a 13-year follow-up of about 19,000 middle-aged men who attended the first screening visit within the Helsinki Heart Study and were free of clinically verified prostate cancer at baseline. Through record linkage with the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry, 149 prostate cancer cases were identified in the cohort. They were matched (1:4) to probability density sampled controls for age, time of sample retrieval, and residence. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-{VD)} at entry were measured for cases and controls. The relative risks of prostate cancer were derived using conditional logistic regression analysis. {RESULTS:} Prostate cancer risk, analyzed by quartiles of the 25-{VD} levels, was inversely related to 25-{VD.} Men with 25-{VD} concentration below the median had an adjusted relative risk ({OR)} of 1.7 compared to men with 25-{VD} level above the median. The prostate cancer risk was highest among younger men ({\textless} 52 years) at entry and low serum 25-{VD} ({OR} 3.1 nonadjusted and 3.5 adjusted). Among those younger men ({\textless} 52 years), low 25-{VD} entailed a higher risk of non-localized cancers ({OR} 6.3). The mean age at diagnosis of the patients with 25-{VD} concentration above the median was 1.8 years higher than that of patients with vitamin D below the median (63.1 vs 61.3 years). {CONCLUSIONS:} We conclude that low levels of 25-{VD} associated with an increased risk for subsequent earlier exposure and more aggressive development of prostate cancer, especially before the andropause.},

  Abstract                 = {A useful summary measure for survival data is the expectation of life, which is calculated by obtaining the area under a survival curve. The loss in expectation of life due to a certain type of cancer is the difference between the expectation of life in the general population and the expectation of life among the cancer patients. This measure is used little in practice as its estimation generally requires extrapolation of both the expected and observed survival. A parametric distribution can be used for extrapolation of the observed survival, but it is difficult to find a distribution that captures the underlying shape of the survival function after the end of follow-up. In this paper, we base our extrapolation on relative survival, because it is more stable and reliable. Relative survival is defined as the observed survival divided by the expected survival, and the mortality analogue is excess mortality. Approaches have been suggested for extrapolation of relative survival within life-table data, by assuming that the excess mortality has reached zero (statistical cure) or has stabilized to a constant. We propose the use of flexible parametric survival models for relative survival, which enables estimating the loss in expectation of life on individual level data by making these assumptions or by extrapolating the estimated linear trend at the end of follow-up. We have evaluated the extrapolation from this model using data on four types of cancer, and the results agree well with observed data. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Published studies suggesting a relationship between vitamin D and some common cancers sparked interest in the association of vitamin D with head and neck cancers. Prolonged darker months in Finland are associated with lower levels of ultraviolet B radiation, raising concerns about low vitamin D levels. Methods: We used a nested case–control study in the prospective Alpha-Tocopherol Beta Carotene ({ATBC)} Study of male smokers in Finland, to examine the relationship between serum 25({OH)D} and risk of developing squamous cancers of the head and neck. Using conditional logistic regression, we calculated the multivariate adjusted {ORs} and {CIs} comparing those with serum 25({OH)D} adequate levels of 50 to {\textless}75 {nmol/L} to those {\textless}25.0. Results: We identified incident cancers of the oral cavity (n = 134), pharynx (n = 48), and larynx (n = 158). Median serum vitamin D was 31 {nmol/L} (interquartile range: 21–48), which is below the 50 {nmol/L} cutoff point was considered adequate for bone and overall health. Comparing those with serum 25({OH)D} below 25 {nmol/L} to those 50 to {\textless}75 {nmol/L} as the referent, the {OR} was 1.35 (95\% {CI:} 0.53–3.43, Ptrend = 0.65) for overall head and neck cancers. Stratification by cancer subsites of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx (Ptrend = 0.93, 0.78, 0.26, respectively) or by season of blood draw also showed no association. Conclusions: Our study showed no association between serum 25({OH)D} and risk of head and neck cancers. Impact: This study does not support the hypothesis that greater vitamin D exposure would reduce the risk of developing head and neck squamous cancers.

  Abstract                 = {Vitamins D2 and D3 are generally considered to be equivalent in humans. Nevertheless, physicians commonly report equivocal responses to seemingly large doses of the only high-dose calciferol (vitamin D2) available in the {U.S.} market. The relative potencies of vitamins D2 and D3 were evaluated by administering single doses of 50,000 {IU} of the respective calciferols to 20 healthy male volunteers, following the time course of serum vitamin D and 25-hydroxyvitamin D ({25OHD)} over a period of 28 d and measuring the area under the curve of the rise in {25OHD} above baseline. The two calciferols produced similar rises in serum concentration of the administered vitamin, indicating equivalent absorption. Both produced similar initial rises in serum {25OHD} over the first 3 d, but {25OHD} continued to rise in the D3-treated subjects, peaking at 14 d, whereas serum {25OHD} fell rapidly in the D2-treated subjects and was not different from baseline at 14 d. Area under the curve ({AUC)} to d 28 was 60.2 ng·d/ml (150.5 nmol·d/liter) for vitamin D2 and 204.7 (511.8) for vitamin D3 (P {\textless} 0.002). Calculated {AUC∞} indicated an even greater differential, with the relative potencies for {D3:D2} being 9.5:1. Vitamin D2 potency is less than one third that of vitamin D3. Physicians resorting to use of vitamin D2 should be aware of its markedly lower potency and shorter duration of action relative to vitamin D3.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Although there is no proven benefit associated with screening for lung cancer, screening programs are attracting many individuals who perceive themselves to be at high risk due to smoking. We sought to determine whether the risk of lung cancer varies predictably among smokers. Methods: We used data on 18 172 subjects enrolled in the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial ({CARET)—a} large, randomized trial of lung cancer prevention—to derive a lung cancer risk prediction model. Model inputs included the subject’s age, sex, asbestos exposure history, and smoking history. We assessed the model’s calibration by comparing predicted and observed rates of lung cancer across risk deciles and validated it by assessing the extent to which a model estimated on data from five {CARET} study sites could predict events in the sixth study site. We then applied the model to evaluate the risk of lung cancer among smokers enrolled in a study of lung cancer screening with computed tomography ({CT).} Results: The model was internally valid and well calibrated. Ten-year lung cancer risk varied greatly among participants in the {CT} study, from 15\% for a 68-year-old man who has smoked two packs per day for 50 years and continues to smoke, to 0.8\% for a 51-year-old woman who smoked one pack per day for 28 years before quitting 9 years earlier. Even among the subset of {CT} study participants who would be eligible for a clinical trial of cancer prevention, risk varied greatly. Conclusions: The risk of lung cancer varies widely among smokers. Accurate risk prediction may help individuals who are contemplating voluntary screening to balance the potential benefits and risks. Risk prediction may also be useful for researchers designing clinical trials of lung cancer prevention.},

  Abstract                 = {Large cohort studies of rare outcomes require extensive data collection, often for many relatively uninformative subjects. Sampling schemes have been proposed that oversample certain groups. For example, the case-cohort design of Prentice (1986, Biometrika 73, 1-11) provides an efficient method of analysis of failure time data. However, the variance estimate must explicitly correct for correlated score contributions. A simple robust variance estimator is proposed that allows for more complicated sampling mechanisms. The variance estimate uses a jackknife estimate of the variance of the individual influence function and is shown to be equivalent to a robust variance estimator proposed by Lin and Wei (1989, Journal of the American Statistical Association 84, 1074-1078) for the standard Cox model. Simulation results indicate excellent agreement with corrected asymptotic estimates and appropriate test size. The technique is illustrated with data evaluating the efficacy of mammography screening in reducing breast cancer mortality.},

Covariate information is collected from all failures and a representative sample of censored observations. Sampling is done without respect to time or disease status, and, therefore, the design is more flexible than a nested case-control design. Despite the efficiency of the methods, case-cohort designs are not often used because of perceived analytic complexity. In this article, we illustrate computation of a simple variance estimator and discuss model fitting techniques in {SAS.} Three different weighting methods are considered. Model fitting is demonstrated in an occupational exposure study of nickel refinery workers. The design is compared to a nested case-control design with respect to analysis and efficiency in a small simulation. In this example, case-cohort sampling from the full cohort was more efficient than using a comparable nested case-control design.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple imputation has become easier to perform with the advent of several software packages that provide imputations under a multivariate normal model, but imputation of missing binary data remains an important practical problem. Here, we explore three alternative methods for converting a multivariate normal imputed value into a binary imputed value: (1) simple rounding of the imputed value to the nearer of 0 or 1, (2) a Bernoulli draw based on a ‘coin flip’ where an imputed value between 0 and 1 is treated as the probability of drawing a 1, and (3) an adaptive rounding scheme where the cut-off value for determining whether to round to 0 or 1 is based on a normal approximation to the binomial distribution, making use of the marginal proportions of 0's and 1's on the variable. We perform simulation studies on a data set of 206 802 respondents to the California Healthy Kids Survey, where the fully observed data on 198 262 individuals defines the population, from which we repeatedly draw samples with missing data, impute, calculate statistics and confidence intervals, and compare bias and coverage against the true values. Frequently, we found satisfactory bias and coverage properties, suggesting that approaches such as these that are based on statistical approximations are preferable in applied research to either avoiding settings where missing data occur or relying on complete-case analyses. Considering both the occurrence and extent of deficits in coverage, we found that adaptive rounding provided the best performance. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

It has become common practice to sample four or five controls per case; however, previous research has shown that in certain instances, significant gains in relative efficiency can be realized when more controls are matched to each case. This study expanded upon this and investigated the effect of (i) the number of cases, (ii) the strength of the exposure–response, and (iii) the skewness of the exposure distribution on the bias and relative efficiency of the conditional likelihood estimator from a nested case–control study. Methods: Cohorts were simulated and analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Results: The relative efficiency decreased and bias away from the null increased, as the true exposure–response parameter increased and the skewness of the exposure distribution of the risk-sets increased. This became more pronounced when the number of cases in the cohort was small. Conclusions: Gains in relative efficiency and a reduction in bias can be realized by sampling more than four or five controls per case generally used, especially when there are few cases, a strong exposure–response relation, and a skewed exposure variable.},

Assessing vitamin D status in epidemiologic studies, however, is challenging given finite resources and limitations of commonly used approaches. Using multivariable linear regression, we derived predicted 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25({OH)D]} scores based on known determinants of circulating 25({OH)D}, including age, race, ultraviolet-B radiation flux at residence, dietary and supplementary vitamin D intakes, body mass index, physical activity, alcohol intake, postmenopausal hormone use (women only), and season of blood draw, in three nationwide cohorts: the Nurses' Health Study ({NHS)}, {NHSII}, and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. The model r2 for each cohort ranged from 0.25 to 0.33. We validated the prediction models in independent samples of participants from these studies. Mean measured 25({OH)D} levels rose with increasing decile of predicted 25({OH)D} score, such that differences in mean measured 25({OH)D} between extreme deciles of predicted 25({OH)D} were 8.7–12.3 {ng/mL.} Substituting predicted 25({OH)D} scores for measured 25({OH)D} in a previously published case-control analysis of colorectal cancer yielded similar effect estimates with odds ratios of approximately 0.8 for a 10-{ng/mL} difference in either plasma or predicted 25({OH)D.} We conclude that these data provide reasonable evidence that a predicted 25({OH)D} score is an acceptable marker for ranking individuals by long-term vitamin D status and may be particularly useful in research settings where biomarkers are not available for a majority of a study population.},

  Abstract                 = {Competing risks analysis considers time-to-first-event (‘survival time’) and the event type (‘cause’), possibly subject to right-censoring. The cause-, i.e. event-specific hazards, completely determine the competing risk process, but simulation studies often fall back on the much criticized latent failure time model. Cause-specific hazard-driven simulation appears to be the exception; if done, usually only constant hazards are considered, which will be unrealistic in many medical situations. We explain simulating competing risks data based on possibly time-dependent cause-specific hazards. The simulation design is as easy as any other, relies on identifiable quantities only and adds to our understanding of the competing risks process. In addition, it immediately generalizes to more complex multistate models. We apply the proposed simulation design to computing the least false parameter of a misspecified proportional subdistribution hazard model, which is a research question of independent interest in competing risks. The simulation specifications have been motivated by data on infectious complications in stem-cell transplanted patients, where results from cause-specific hazards analyses were difficult to interpret in terms of cumulative event probabilities. The simulation illustrates that results from a misspecified proportional subdistribution hazard analysis can be interpreted as a time-averaged effect on the cumulative event probability scale.

Vitamin D–binding protein was measured from stored serum samples. Bioavailable 25({OH)D} and 1,25({OH)2D} were determined using previously validated formulae. Associations with demographic factors and measures of mineral metabolism were examined. When compared with whites, black patients had lower levels of total, but not bioavailable, 25({OH)D.} Bioavailable, but not total, 25({OH)D} and 1,25({OH)2D} were each significantly correlated with serum calcium. In univariate and multivariate regression analysis, only bioavailable 25({OH)D} was significantly associated with parathyroid hormone levels. Hence, bioavailable vitamin D levels are better correlated with measures of mineral metabolism than total levels in patients on hemodialysis.},

Subjects and Design: Blood from 34 healthy male and female adults, aged 18 to 79 years, from a placebo-controlled, double-blind study who received a placebo, 1000 {IU} vitamin D3, or 1000 {IU} vitamin D2 daily for 11 weeks at end of winter was analyzed. Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25({OH)2D2}, and 1,25({OH)2D3} were determined by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectroscopy. Results: Of the adults, 82\% were vitamin D insufficient (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25({OH)D} {\textless}30 {ng/mL])} at the start of the study. Administration of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 induced similar increases in total 25({OH)D} as well as in 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, respectively. Compared with placebo and adjusting for baseline levels, 1000 {IU} daily of vitamin D2 was associated with a mean increase of 7.4 {pg/mL} (95\% confidence interval, 4.4–10.3) in 1,25({OH)2D2}, which was accompanied by a mean decrease of 9.9 {pg/mL} (−15.8 to −4.0) in 1,25({OH)2D3.} No such differences accompanied administration of 1000 {IU} daily of vitamin D3. Conclusion: Vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 were effective in raising and maintaining total serum concentrations of 25({OH)D.} Ingestion of vitamin D2 also resulted in an increase in serum concentrations of 1,25({OH)2D2.} This increase was accompanied by a comparable decrease in serum concentrations of 1,25({OH)2D3;} therefore, the total 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25({OH)2D]} concentrations did not significantly change after 11 weeks compared with baseline levels. Ingestion of vitamin D3 did not alter serum concentrations of 1,25({OH)2D3} or total 1,25({OH)2D.} Therefore, ingestion of 1000 {IU} vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 for 11 weeks was effective in raising total serum concentrations of 25({OH)D} as well as sustaining serum concentrations of total 1,25({OH)2D.}},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Frequent use of personal, nonprotocol calcium supplements obscured an adverse effect of coadministered calcium and vitamin D ({CaD)} on cardiovascular risk in the Women's Health Initiative ({WHI).} Objective: We investigated the effects of the use of personal calcium or vitamin D supplements on other outcomes in the {WHI} {CaD} Study ({WHI} {CaD)} by using the {WHI} limited-access clinical trials data set. Design: The {WHI} {CaD} was a 7-y, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of {CaD} (1 g Ca/400 {IU} vitamin D daily) in 36,282 community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. The incidence of total cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers), breast and colorectal cancers, hip and total fracture, and mortality was assessed by using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: In the {WHI} {CaD}, interactions between the use of either personal calcium or vitamin D supplements and {CaD} were found for total, breast, and colorectal cancers but not for fracture or mortality. In 15,646 women (43\%) who were not taking personal calcium or vitamin D supplements at randomization, {CaD} significantly decreased the risk of total, breast, and invasive breast cancers by 14–20\% and nonsignificantly reduced the risk of colorectal cancer by 17\%. In women taking personal calcium or vitamin D supplements, {CaD} did not alter cancer risk ({HR:} 1.06–1.26). Conclusions: For women in the {WHI} {CaD} who were not taking personal calcium or vitamin D supplements at randomization, {CaD} decreased the risk of total, breast, and colorectal cancers and did not change the risk of fractures or total mortality. The nonskeletal effects of {CaD} may be more important than the skeletal effects and should be considered when evaluating these supplements.

Follow-up prostate-specific antigen and death data were obtained via record linkage to pathology laboratories and the Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages. Poisson regression models with {PCSM} as the outcome were fit to the data. Models included age at surgery, Gleason score and tumour stage as covariates. {RESULTS:} Median post-surgery and post-{BCR} follow-up was 10.3 and 7.5 years, respectively. 695 men (33 \%) experienced {BCR} during follow-up, of which 82 \% occurred within 5 years of {RP;} 66 men died from prostate cancer. Men with combined high Gleason sum (≥4 + 3) and extra-prostatic ({≥pT3a)} disease had substantially increased mortality rate with early {BCR}, while those experiencing {BCR} after a longer interval had significantly lower mortality. Men with combined low Gleason sum (≤3 + 4) and organ-confined disease ({≤pT2c)} risk disease were not at any substantial risk of death in this time frame regardless of timing of {BCR} following {RP.} {CONCLUSIONS:} This study evaluates the temporal relationship between {BCR} and {PCSM} using a whole-of-population cohort of men treated with {RP.} Men with low-risk features of prostate cancer at time of {RP} have low mortality even if they experience early {BCR.} This subgroup may be counselled regarding their favourable long-term prognosis.},

These techniques are illustrated for a number of sampling designs, including three novel designs: counter-matching with additional randomly sampled controls; quota sampling of controls; and nested case-control sampling with number of controls dependent on the failure's exposure status. General asymptotic theory is developed for the maximum partial likelihood estimator and cumulative baseline hazard estimator and is used to derive the asymptotic distributions for estimators from a large class of designs.},

After allowing for energy and other major covariates, a significant inverse association was found for vitamin E (odds ratio, {OR}, for the highest quintile of intake versus the lowest one 0.56, 95\% confidence interval, {CI} 0.41–0.75), and vitamin C ({OR} = 0.72, 95\% {CI} = 0.54–0.96), although the trend in risk for vitamin C was of borderline significance. No significant trend of decreasing risk was found for other micronutrients analyzed, although for most of them the risk estimates were below unity for intakes above the lowest. The {ORs} for the upper quintile of intake when compared with the lowest one were 0.80 (95\% confidence interval, {CI} = 0.59–1.08) for retinol, 0.82 (95\% {CI} = 0.61–1.10) for α-carotene, 0.90 (95\% {CI} = 0.68–1.20) for β-carotene, 0.94 (95\% {CI} = 0.73–1.21) for β-criptoxanthin, 0.85 (95\% {CI} = 0.63–1.14) for lutein/zeaxanthin, 0.76 (95\% {CI} = 0.57–1.01) for vitamin D, 0.75 (95\% {CI} = 0.55–1.01) for thiamine, 0.88 (95\% {CI} = 0.66–1.19) for riboflavin, 0.85 for vitamin B6 (95\% {CI} = 0.64–1.13), 0.85 (95\% {CI} = 0.64–1.12) for folate and 0.80 (95\% {CI} = 0.60–1.07) for niacin.

In the second session, after the stories had been read, children were asked to read short lists of target nonwords or homophonic alternatives. Children read target nonwords faster than homophones, indicating that they had formed functional orthographic representations of the target nonwords through phonologically recoding them during silent story reading. They also preferred target nonwords to homophones in an orthographic choice task in which the alternatives included the target, the homophone, and a visually similar foil, although here orthographic learning was stronger for items encountered eight times within stories and stronger for items tested immediately. These findings provide critical evidence in support of Share’s self-teaching through phonological recoding hypothesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Lung cancer is the most common form of cancer death worldwide. Although reduction of tobacco consumption remains the most appropriate strategy to reduce lung-cancer burden, identification of genes involved in the cause of disease could contribute to further understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and eventually lead to additional prevention strategies and targeted treatments. Common gene variants involved in lung cancer have been recently identified through large, collaborative, genome-wide association studies. These studies identified three separate loci that are associated with lung cancer (5p15, 6p21, and 15q25) and include genes that regulate acetylcholine nicotinic receptors and telomerase production. However, much about genetic risk remains to be discovered, and rarer gene variants, such as those of the {CHEK2} gene, likely account for most of the remaining risk. There is also a need for studies that investigate how genetic susceptibility is associated with clinical outcome measures, including treatment response and tumour relapse.},

Sampling strategy, on the other hoand, creates challenges for data analysis because of outcome-dependent missingness in biomarker measurements. In this paper, we propose inverse probability weighted ({IPW)} methods for making inference about the prognostic accuracy of a novel biomarker for predicting future events with data from {NCC} studies. The consistency and asymptotic normality of these estimators are derived using the empirical process theory and convergence theorems for sequences of weakly dependent random variables. Simulation and analysis using Framingham Offspring Study data suggest that the proposed methods perform well in finite samples.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose Recent increases in incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States have been attributed to human papillomavirus ({HPV)} infection, but empirical evidence is lacking. Patients and Methods {HPV} status was determined for all 271 oropharyngeal cancers (1984-2004) collected by the three population-based cancer registries in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER)} Residual Tissue Repositories Program by using polymerase chain reaction and genotyping (Inno-{LiPA)}, {HPV16} viral load, and {HPV16} {mRNA} expression. Trends in {HPV} prevalence across four calendar periods were estimated by using logistic regression. Observed {HPV} prevalence was reweighted to all oropharyngeal cancers within the cancer registries to account for nonrandom selection and to calculate incidence trends. Survival of {HPV-positive} and {HPV-negative} patients was compared by using Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses. Results {HPV} prevalence in oropharyngeal cancers significantly increased over calendar time regardless of {HPV} detection assay (P trend {\textless} .05). For example, {HPV} prevalence by Inno-{LiPA} increased from 16.3\% during 1984 to 1989 to 71.7\% during 2000 to 2004. Median survival was significantly longer for {HPV-positive} than for {HPV-negative} patients (131 v 20 months; log-rank P {\textless} .001; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.31; 95\% {CI}, 0.21 to 0.46). Survival significantly increased across calendar periods for {HPV-positive} (P = .003) but not for {HPV-negative} patients (P = .18). Population-level incidence of {HPV-positive} oropharyngeal cancers increased by 225\% (95\% {CI}, 208\% to 242\%) from 1988 to 2004 (from 0.8 per 100,000 to 2.6 per 100,000), and incidence for {HPV-negative} cancers declined by 50\% (95\% {CI}, 47\% to 53\%; from 2.0 per 100,000 to 1.0 per 100,000). If recent incidence trends continue, the annual number of {HPV-positive} oropharyngeal cancers is expected to surpass the annual number of cervical cancers by the year 2020. Conclusion Increases in the population-level incidence and survival of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States since 1984 are caused by {HPV} infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and the prognostic evaluation of cancer patients is of great importance in medical care. The use of artificial neural networks in prediction problems is well established in human medical literature. The aim of the current study was to assess the prognostic value of a series of clinical and molecular variables with the addition of γ-{H2AX—a} new {DNA} damage response marker—for the prediction of prognosis in patients with early operable non-small cell lung cancer by comparing the γ-{H2AX-based} artificial network prediction model with the corresponding {LR} one. Two prognostic models of 96 patients with 27 input variables were constructed by using the parameter-increasing method in order to compare the predictive accuracy of neural network and logistic regression models. The quality of the models was evaluated by an independent validation data set of 11 patients. Neural networks outperformed logistic regression in predicting the patient's outcome according to the experimental results. To assess the importance of the two factors p53 and γ-{H2AX}, models without these two variables were also constructed. {JR} and accuracy of these models were lower than those of the models using all input variables, suggesting that these biological markers are very important for optimal performance of the models. This study indicates that neural networks may represent a potentially more useful decision support tool than conventional statistical methods for predicting the outcome of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and that some molecular markers, such as γ-{H2AX}, enhance their predictive ability.},

Data from 11 studies on vitamin D intake, 7 studies on circulating 25({OH)D} levels, 3 studies of circulating 1alpha,25({OH)(2)D} levels, and 15 studies on calcium intake and breast cancer risk were included in this analysis. From the meta-analysis, there was a significant inverse relationship between vitamin D intake and breast cancer risk, with an overall relative risk ({RR)} of high versus low vitamin D intake for breast cancer of 0.91 (95\% {CI} = 0.85-0.97). The highest quantile of circulating 25({OH)D} was found to be associated with a 45\% ({OR} = 0.55, 95\% {CI} = 0.38-0.80) decrease in breast cancer when compared with the lowest quantile. No significant association for the circulating 1alpha,25({OH)(2)D} level and breast cancer was found ({OR} = 0.99, 95\% {CI} = 0.68-1.44). For calcium, a 19\% ({RR} = 0.81, 95\% {CI} = 0.72-0.90) decrease in breast cancer risk was found for those with highest quantile of calcium intake compared to the lowest quantile. These results provide strong evidence that vitamin D and calcium have a chemopreventive effect against breast cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {For studies of time to illness, the prospective cohort study is, in general, the method of choice. When the time of origin is known for all subjects, then a prevalent cohort study in which individuals are recruited at variable times after the start of the illness process is a suitable alternative. Often, when a prevalent cohort is being formed, data may also be available on individuals who are already ill but are alive. The incorporation of such data, which is practically appealing to many researchers, is discussed. The nature of the required assumptions and the need also to model the illness to death process are illustrated. Full likelihood and pseudolikelihood techniques are outlined and compared with each other and with the use of only prevalent cohort data in a small simulation study. An example based on an {HIV} seroconverter study is discussed for illustration. The full likelihood method is seen to be too complex for general application. The use of pseudolikelihoods is easier to implement. If there is reliable information on initiating event times and recruitment strategies are well defined, then the incorporation of retrospective data may be beneficial. In other situations, their incorporation is too problematic to be recommended.},

We present a broadly applicable method for the removal of unwanted variation arising from various sources for the identification of differentially abundant metabolites and, hence, for the systematic integration of data on the same quantities from different sources. We illustrate the versatility and the performance of the approach in four applications, and we show that it has several advantages over the existing normalization methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose We developed a model to estimate the 5-year absolute risk of melanoma to efficiently identify individuals at increased risk of melanoma for potential interventions. Patients and Methods We used data from a case-control study with 718 non-Hispanic white patients with invasive cutaneous melanoma from melanoma clinics in Philadelphia, {PA} and San Francisco, {CA;} matched controls were 945 patients from outpatient clinics with similar catchment areas. All participants underwent extensive interviews and skin examinations. We selected easily obtained clinical characteristics and responses to simple questions for study in order to develop sex-specific relative risk models. These models were combined with incidence and mortality rates by United States geographic areas to develop estimates of the absolute risk of developing melanoma within 5 years. Results Relative risk models yielded an attributable risk of 86\% for men and 89\% for women, using at most seven variables. Attributable risks did not vary by age, ultraviolet B flux or hours outdoors. The absolute individual risks varied widely, depending on age, other host characteristics, and geographic area. Individual absolute risk can be estimated using a program available online. Conclusion Our procedures allow for estimating the absolute risk of developing melanoma to assist in the identification of patients at high risk. Such high-risk individuals could undergo interventions including a complete skin examination, counseling to avoid sun exposures, regular self and professional surveillance, or participation in prevention trials. It is important to emphasize that these projections are not intended to identify current melanoma cases.},

This review examines this paradox and also discusses the cell and gene targets influenced by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D that may account for the anti-cancer actions of vitamin D. A review of the literature shows that while vitamin D-induced growth arrest and apoptosis of tumor cells or their non-neoplastic progenitors are plausible mechanisms, other gene targets related to {DNA} repair and immunomodulation, and other cell targets such as the stromal cells and cells of the immune system, may be regulated by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D and contribute to vitamin D mediated cancer prevention.},

The {TSCE} model is traditionally fitted to prospective cohort data. Here, the authors describe a new method that allows for the reconstruction of cohort data from the combination of risk factor data obtained from a case-control study, and tabled incidence/mortality rate data, and discuss alternative approaches. The method is applied to fit a {TSCE} model based on smoking. The fitted model is validated against independent data from the control arm of a lung cancer chemoprevention trial, {CARET}, where it accurately predicted the number of lung cancer deaths observed.},

Direct cytocidal activity and angiogenic activity were evaluated by 48-hour {MTT} assay and by the colorimetric method, respectively. {RESULTS:} Both {VD} agents inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the life span of Renca-bearing mice in a dose-dependent manner and both suppressed tumor growth in athymic mice and euthymic mice with eliminated {NK} activity. Marginal body-weight loss without appreciable hypercalcemia was observed in mice given {VD} agents. When treatment was delayed on day 7, the {VD} agents failed to inhibit tumor growth. The {MTT} assay showed no direct cytotoxicity of {VD} agents on Renca. Tumor angiogenesis was inhibited to 46 to 30\% of the control level by {VD} agents. Furthermore, {VD} agents reduced pulmonary and hepatic foci in the metastatic models. {CONCLUSIONS:} These results suggest that {VD} agents may be effective as a treatment for renal cell carcinoma, especially when micrometastases are involved.},

  Abstract                 = {Microarray expression studies suffer from the problem of batch effects and other unwanted variation. Many methods have been proposed to adjust microarray data to mitigate the problems of unwanted variation. Several of these methods rely on factor analysis to infer the unwanted variation from the data. A central problem with this approach is the difficulty in discerning the unwanted variation from the biological variation that is of interest to the researcher. We present a new method, intended for use in differential expression studies, that attempts to overcome this problem by restricting the factor analysis to negative control genes. Negative control genes are genes known a priori not to be differentially expressed with respect to the biological factor of interest. Variation in the expression levels of these genes can therefore be assumed to be unwanted variation. We name this method {"Remove} Unwanted Variation, 2-step" ({RUV-2).} We discuss various techniques for assessing the performance of an adjustment method and compare the performance of {RUV-2} with that of other commonly used adjustment methods such as Combat and Surrogate Variable Analysis ({SVA).} We present several example studies, each concerning genes differentially expressed with respect to gender in the brain and find that {RUV-2} performs as well or better than other methods. Finally, we discuss the possibility of adapting {RUV-2} for use in studies not concerned with differential expression and conclude that there may be promise but substantial challenges remain.},

  Abstract                 = {We study bias arising from rounding categorical variables following multivariate normal ({MVN)} imputation. This task has been well studied for binary variables, but not for more general categorical variables. Three methods that assign imputed values to categories based on fixed reference points are compared using 25 specific scenarios covering variables with k=3, …, 7 categories, and five distributional shapes, and for each k=3, …, 7, we examine the distribution of bias arising over 100,000 distributions drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet distribution. We observed, on both empirical and theoretical grounds, that one method (projected-distance-based rounding) is superior to the other two methods, and that the risk of invalid inference with the best method may be too high at sample sizes n≥150 at 50\% missingness, n≥250 at 30\% missingness and n≥1500 at 10\% missingness. Therefore, these methods are generally unsatisfactory for rounding categorical variables (with up to seven categories) following {MVN} imputation.},

  Abstract                 = {The Cohort Consortium Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers ({VDPP)}, a consortium of 10 prospective cohort studies from the United States, Finland, and China, was formed to examine the associations between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25({OH)D)} concentrations and the risk of rarer cancers. Cases (total n = 5,491) included incident primary endometrial (n = 830), kidney (n = 775), ovarian (n = 516), pancreatic (n = 952), and upper gastrointestinal tract (n = 1,065) cancers and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1,353) diagnosed in the participating cohorts. At least 1 control was matched to each case on age, date of blood collection (1974–2006), sex, and race/ethnicity (n = 6,714). Covariate data were obtained from each cohort in a standardized manner. The majority of the serum or plasma samples were assayed in a central laboratory using a direct, competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay on the {DiaSorin} {LIAISON} platform ({DiaSorin}, Inc., Stillwater, Minnesota). Masked quality control samples included serum standards from the {US} National Institute of Standards and Technology. Conditional logistic regression analyses were conducted using clinically defined cutpoints, with 50–{\textless}75 {nmol/L} as the reference category. Meta-analyses were also conducted using inverse-variance weights in random-effects models. This consortium approach permits estimation of the association between 25({OH)D} and several rarer cancers with high accuracy and precision across a wide range of 25({OH)D} concentrations.},

To address this gap in knowledge, the authors examined the association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25({OH)D)} and kidney cancer within a large, nested case-control study developed as part of the Cohort Consortium Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers. Concentrations of 25({OH)D} were measured from 775 kidney cancer cases and 775 age-, sex-, race-, and season-matched controls from 8 prospective cohort studies. Overall, neither low nor high concentrations of circulating 25({OH)D} were significantly associated with kidney cancer risk. Although the data showed a statistically significant decreased risk for females (odds ratio = 0.31, 95\% confidence interval: 0.12, 0.85) with 25({OH)D} concentrations of ≥75 {nmol/L}, the linear trend was not statistically significant and the number of cases in this category was small (n = 14). The findings from this consortium-based study do not support the hypothesis that vitamin D is inversely associated with the risk of kidney cancer overall or with renal cell carcinoma specifically.},

  Abstract                 = {Case-cohort and nested case-control designs are often used to select an appropriate subsample of individuals from prospective cohort studies. Despite the great attention that has been given to the calculation of association estimators, no formal methods have been described for estimating risk prediction measures from these 2 sampling designs. Using real data from the Swedish Twin Registry (2004–2009), the authors sampled unstratified and stratified (matched) case-cohort and nested case-control subsamples and compared them with the full cohort (as “gold standard”). The real biomarker (high density lipoprotein cholesterol) and simulated biomarkers ({BIO1} and {BIO2)} were studied in terms of association with cardiovascular disease, individual risk of cardiovascular disease at 3 years, and main prediction metrics. Overall, stratification improved efficiency, with stratified case-cohort designs being comparable to matched nested case-control designs. Individual risks and prediction measures calculated by using case-cohort and nested case-control designs after appropriate reweighting could be assessed with good efficiency, except for the finely matched nested case-control design, where matching variables could not be included in the individual risk estimation. In conclusion, the authors have shown that case-cohort and nested case-control designs can be used in settings where the research aim is to evaluate the prediction ability of new markers and that matching strategies for nested case-control designs may lead to biased prediction measures.},

Methods Prediagnostic folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, cysteine, riboflavin, and homocysteine concentrations were measured in fasting serum from 224 incident {RCC} cases and 224 controls (matched on age and date of serum collection). Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios ({ORs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs)}, adjusted for potential confounders. Results Serum folate tended to be inversely associated with {RCC}, compared to the first quartile, the odds ratios (95\% {CI)} for subsequent quartiles were 0.62 (0.35–1.08), 0.52 (0.29–0.93), and 0.67 (0.37–1.20) (P-trend = 0.19). When modeled as a threshold effect, subjects in the lowest serum folate quartile (≤6.64 nmol/l), which corresponds to deficient folate status, had a significant increased {RCC} risk ({OR} = 1.68, 95\% {CI} 1.06–2.65) compared to those with higher serum folate. The other one-carbon metabolism biomarkers were not associated with {RCC.} Conclusions This study in male smokers suggests that deficient folate status may increase risk of {RCC}, but confirmation is needed in other epidemiologic studies that include women and non-smokers.},

  Abstract                 = {Background  Vitamin D insufficiency is associated with suboptimal health. The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency may be rising, but population-based trends are uncertain. We sought to evaluate {US} population trends in vitamin D {insufficiency.Methods} We compared serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[{OH]D)} levels from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES} {III)}, collected during 1988 through 1994, with {NHANES} data collected from 2001 through 2004 ({NHANES} 2001-2004). Complete data were available for 18 883 participants in {NHANES} {III} and 13 369 participants in {NHANES} 2001-{2004.Results} The mean serum 25({OH)D} level was 30 (95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 29-30) {ng/mL} during {NHANES} {III} and decreased to 24 (23-25) {ng/mL} during {NHANES} 2001-2004. Accordingly, the prevalence of 25({OH)D} levels of less than 10 {ng/mL} increased from 2\% (95\% {CI}, 2\%-2\%) to 6\% (5\%-8\%), and 25({OH)D} levels of 30 {ng/mL} or more decreased from 45\% (43\%-47\%) to 23\% (20\%-26\%). The prevalence of 25({OH)D} levels of less than 10 {ng/mL} in non-Hispanic blacks rose from 9\% during {NHANES} {III} to 29\% during {NHANES} 2001-2004, with a corresponding decrease in the prevalence of levels of 30 {ng/mL} or more from 12\% to 3\%. Differences by age strata (mean serum 25[{OH]D} levels ranging from 28-32 {ng/mL)} and sex (28 {ng/mL} for women and 32 {ng/mL} for men) during {NHANES} {III} equalized during {NHANES} 2001-2004 (24 vs 24 {ng/mL} for age and 24 vs 24 {ng/mL} for {sex).Conclusions} National data demonstrate a marked decrease in serum 25({OH)D} levels from the 1988-1994 to the 2001-2004 {NHANES} data collections. Racial/ethnic differences have persisted and may have important implications for known health disparities. Current recommendations for vitamin D supplementation are inadequate to address the growing epidemic of vitamin D insufficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {In vitro and animal studies indicate that vitamin D may have anti-cancer benefits, including against progression and metastasis, against a wide spectrum of cancers. Supporting an anti-cancer effect of vitamin D is the ability of many cells to convert 25({OH)D}, the primary circulating form of vitamin D, into 1,25({OH)2D}, the most active form of this vitamin. No epidemiologic studies have directly measured vitamin D concentrations or intakes on risk of total cancer incidence or mortality. However, higher rates of total cancer mortality in regions with less {UV-B} radiation, and among African-Americans and overweight and obese people, each associated with lower circulating vitamin D, are compatible with a benefit of vitamin D on mortality. In addition, poorer survival from cancer in individuals diagnosed in the months when vitamin D levels are lowest suggests a benefit of vitamin D against late stages of carcinogenesis. The only individual cancer sites that have been examined directly in relation to vitamin D status are colorectal, prostate and breast cancers. For breast cancer, some data are promising for a benefit from vitamin D but are far too sparse to support a conclusion. The evidence that higher 25({OH)D} levels through increased sunlight exposure or dietary or supplement intake inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis is substantial. The biologic evidence for an anti-cancer role of 25({OH)D} is also strong for prostate cancer, but the epidemiologic data have not been supportive. Although not entirely consistent, some studies suggest that higher circulating 1,25({OH)2D} may be more important than 25({OH)D} for protection against aggressive, poorly-differentiated prostate cancer. A possible explanation for these divergent results is that unlike colorectal tumors, prostate cancers lose the ability to hydroxylate 25({OH)D} to 1,25({OH)2D}, and thus may rely on the circulation as the main source of 1,25({OH)2D.} The suppression of circulating 1,25({OH)2D} levels by calcium intake could explain why higher calcium and milk intakes appear to increase risk of advanced prostate cancer. Given the potential benefits from vitamin D, further research should be a priority.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Vitamin D has potent anticancer properties, especially against digestive-system cancers. Many human studies have used geographic residence as a marker of solar ultraviolet B and hence vitamin D exposure. Here, we considered multiple determinants of vitamin D exposure (dietary and supplementary vitamin D, skin pigmentation, adiposity, geographic residence, and leisure-time physical activity—to estimate sunlight exposure) in relation to cancer risk in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Methods: Among 1095 men of this cohort, we quantified the relation of these six determinants to plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25({OH)D]} level by use of a multiple linear regression model. We used results from the model to compute a predicted 25({OH)D} level for each of 47 800 men in the cohort based on these characteristics. We then prospectively examined this variable in relation to cancer risk with multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results: From 1986 through January 31, 2000, we documented 4286 incident cancers (excluding organ-confined prostate cancer and nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 2025 deaths from cancer. From multivariable models, an increment of 25 {nmol/L} in predicted 25({OH)D} level was associated with a 17\% reduction in total cancer incidence (multivariable relative risk [{RR]} = 0.83, 95\% confidence interval [{CI]} = 0.74 to 0.92), a 29\% reduction in total cancer mortality ({RR} = 0.71, 95\% {CI} = 0.60 to 0.83), and a 45\% reduction in digestive-system cancer mortality ({RR} = 0.55, 95\% {CI} = 0.41 to 0.74). The absolute annual rate of total cancer was 758 per 100 000 men in the bottom decile of predicted 25({OH)D} and 674 per 100 000 men for the top decile; these respective rates were 326 per 100 000 and 277 per 100 000 for total cancer mortality and 128 per 100 000 and 78 per 100 000 for digestive-system cancer mortality. Results were similar when we controlled further for body mass index or physical activity level. Conclusions: Low levels of vitamin D may be associated with increased cancer incidence and mortality in men, particularly for digestive-system cancers. The vitamin D supplementation necessary to achieve a 25({OH)D} increment of 25 {nmol/L} may be at least 1500 {IU/day.}},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Solar ultraviolet B ({UVB)} irradiance and vitamin D are associated with reduced cancer mortality rates. However, the previous ecologic study of {UVB} and cancer mortality rates in the {U.S.} (Grant, 2002) did not include other risk factors in the analysis. Materials and Methods: An ecologic study was performed using age-adjusted annual mortality rates for Caucasian Americans for 1950-69 and 1970-94, along with state-averaged values for selected years for alcohol consumption, Hispanic heritage, lung cancer (as a proxy for smoking), poverty, degree of urbanization and {UVB} in multiple regression analyses. Results: Models were developed that explained much of the variance in cancer mortality rates, with stronger correlations for the earlier period. Fifteen types of cancer were inversely-associated with {UVB.} In the earlier period, most of the associations of cancer death rates with alcohol consumption (nine), Hispanic heritage (six), the proxy for smoking (ten), urban residence (seven) and poverty (inverse for eight) agreed well with the literature. Conclusion: These results provide additional support for the hypothesis that solar {UVB}, through photosynthesis of vitamin D, is inversely-associated with cancer mortality rates, and that various other cancer risk-modifying factors do not detract from this link. It is thought that sun avoidance practices after 1980, along with improved cancer treatment, led to reduced associations in the latter period. The results regarding solar {UVB} should be studied further with additional observational and intervention studies of vitamin D indices and cancer incidence, mortality and survival rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Multivariable regression models are powerful tools that are used frequently in studies of clinical outcomes. These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses. However, uncritical application of modelling techniques can result in models that poorly fit the dataset at hand, or, even more likely, inaccurately predict outcomes on new subjects. One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes. Methods are illustrated with a survival analysis in prostate cancer using Cox regression.},

  Abstract                 = {The Cohort Consortium Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers ({VDPP)} brought together 10 cohorts to conduct a prospective study of the association between vitamin D status, measured as serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25({OH)D)}, and the development of 7 rarer cancer sites: endometrial, esophageal, gastric, kidney, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. The cohorts come from 3 continents, with participants from a wide range of latitude who are racially diverse. Across each cancer site, there was no evidence of a protective association between higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D ({\textgreater}75 {nmol/L)} and cancer outcome. An increased risk at very high levels (≥100 {nmol/L)} was noted for pancreatic cancer, confirming previous reports. The articles included in this issue detail the overall design and governance of the project, correlates of vitamin D status, and results from the cancer site-specific investigations. The Vitamin D Pooling Project realizes a major goal of consortium efforts, namely, to rigorously test hypotheses for rarer cancer outcomes that may not be adequately addressed in any one prospective cohort study. The results of this study have application for the planning and conduct of intervention trials, especially in determining potential risks.},

  Abstract                 = {Risk models for lung cancer incidence would be useful for prioritizing individuals for screening and participation in clinical trials of chemoprevention. We present a risk model for lung cancer built using prospective cohort data from a general population which predicts individual incidence in a given time period. We build separate risk models for current and former smokers using 169,035 ever smokers from the multicenter European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition ({EPIC)} and considered a model for never smokers. The data set was split into independent training and test sets. Lung cancer incidence was modeled using survival analysis, stratifying by age started smoking, and for former smokers, also smoking duration. Other risk factors considered were smoking intensity, 10 occupational/environmental exposures previously implicated with lung cancer, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms at two loci identified by genome-wide association studies of lung cancer. Individual risk in the test set was measured by the predicted probability of lung cancer incidence in the year preceding last follow-up time, predictive accuracy was measured by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve ({AUC).} Using smoking information alone gave good predictive accuracy: the {AUC} and 95\% confidence interval in ever smokers was 0.843 (0.810–0.875), the Bach model applied to the same data gave an {AUC} of 0.775 (0.737–0.813). Other risk factors had negligible effect on the {AUC}, including never smokers for whom prediction was poor. Our model is generalizable and straightforward to implement. Its accuracy can be attributed to its modeling of lifetime exposure to smoking. Cancer Prev Res; 5(6); 834–46. ©2012 {AACR.}},

  Abstract                 = {Vitamin D is absolutely essential for the maintenance of a healthy skeleton throughout our lives. There is mounting evidence that vitamin D insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency in elderly people is a silent epidemic that results in bone loss and fractures. It is casual exposure to sunlight that provides most humans with their vitamin D requirement. Seasonal changes, time of day, latitude, aging, sunscreen use, and melanin pigmentation can substantially influence the cutaneous production of vitamin D. Although the recommended dietary allowance for vitamin D in adults is 5 micrograms (200 {IU)}, there is mounting evidence that in the absence of exposure to sunlight the vitamin D requirement is at least 15 micrograms (600 {IU)/d.} The skin is a target tissue for the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol). 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol inhibits the proliferation of cultured keratinocytes and induces them to differentiate. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol and its analogs have been developed as an effective new therapy for the treatment of the hyperproliferative skin disease psoriasis.},

Objective: Our objective was to determine whether vitamin D2 was less effective than vitamin D3 in maintaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels or increased the catabolism of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. Subjects and Design: This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study of healthy adults ages 18–84 yr who received placebo, 1000 {IU} vitamin D3, 1000 {IU} vitamin D2, or 500 {IU} vitamin D2 plus 500 {IU} vitamin D3 daily for 11 wk at the end of the winter. Results: Sixty percent of the healthy adults were vitamin D deficient at the start of the study. The circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (mean ± sd) increased to the same extent in the groups that received 1000 {IU} daily as vitamin D2 (baseline 16.9 ± 10.5 ng/ml; 11 wk 26.8 ± 9.6 ng/ml), vitamin D3 (baseline 19.6 ± 11.1 ng/ml; 11 wk 28.9 ± 11.0 ng/ml), or a combination of 500 {IU} vitamin D2 and 500 {IU} vitamin D3 (baseline 20.2 ± 10.4 ng/ml; 11 wk 28.4 ± 7.7 ng/ml). The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels did not change in the group that received 1000 {IU} vitamin D2 daily. The 1000 {IU} dose of vitamin D2 or vitamin D3 did not raise 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in vitamin D-deficient subjects above 30 ng/ml. Conclusion: A 1000 {IU} dose of vitamin D2 daily was as effective as 1000 {IU} vitamin D3 in maintaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and did not negatively influence serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels. Therefore, vitamin D2 is equally as effective as vitamin D3 in maintaining 25-hydroxyvitamin D status.},

  Abstract                 = {The number of assessments of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25({OH)D]} for diagnostic purposes has increased significantly during the past 5 y. Over the years, techniques for quantifying 25({OH)D} have increased and evolved. Some changes have been for the better and some have not. Most current methods appear to provide valid results as long as the operator of the given technique is properly trained and motivated. In addition, any laboratory that assesses circulating 25({OH)D} for clinical diagnosis needs to participate in the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme. Finally, research has shown that circulating 25({OH)D} is extremely stable in stored serum or plasma samples; this characteristic makes accurate, long-term epidemiologic studies of circulating 25({OH)D} possible. In this article, I provide an overview of the techniques available for measuring 25({OH)D}, compare these techniques with one another, and assess their clinical utility. I also briefly discuss the stability of 25({OH)D} in biological media and present an overview of the Vitamin D External Quality Assessment Scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with over one million cases annually. To identify genetic factors that modify disease risk, we conducted a genome-wide association study by analysing 317,139 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 1,989 lung cancer cases and 2,625 controls from six central European countries. We identified a locus in chromosome region 15q25 that was strongly associated with lung cancer (P = 9 × 10-10). This locus was replicated in five separate lung cancer studies comprising an additional 2,513 lung cancer cases and 4,752 controls (P = 5 × 10-20 overall), and it was found to account for 14\% (attributable risk) of lung cancer cases. Statistically similar risks were observed irrespective of smoking status or propensity to smoke tobacco. The association region contains several genes, including three that encode nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits ({CHRNA5}, {CHRNA3} and {CHRNB4).} Such subunits are expressed in neurons and other tissues, in particular alveolar epithelial cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and lung cancer cell lines, and they bind to N′-nitrosonornicotine and potential lung carcinogens. A non-synonymous variant of {CHRNA5} that induces an amino acid substitution ({D398N)} at a highly conserved site in the second intracellular loop of the protein is among the markers with the strongest disease associations. Our results provide compelling evidence of a locus at 15q25 predisposing to lung cancer, and reinforce interest in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as potential disease candidates and chemopreventative targets.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective. The data are conflicting for the association between the index-to-ring finger length ratio ({2D:4D)} and the risk of {OA.} The aim of this cohort study was to examine the relationship between {2D:4D} and the risk of severe knee and hip {OA} requiring total joint replacement. Methods. A total of 14 511 participants in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study had {2D:4D} assessed from hand photocopies. The incidence of total knee replacement and total hip replacement between 2001 and 2011 was determined by linking the cohort records to the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry. Results. Over an average 10.5 years of follow-up, 580 participants had total knee replacement and 499 had total hip replacement. Greater right {2D:4D} [hazard ratio ({HR)} 0.91 for a s.d. increase in {2D:4D}, 95\% {CI} 0.84, 0.99, P = 0.03] and average right and left {2D:4D} ({HR} 0.91 for a s.d. increase in {2D:4D}, 95\% {CI} 0.84, 0.99, P = 0.02) were associated with a reduced incidence of total knee replacement. These associations persisted when participants whose fingers had any features that might have affected the validity of {2D:4D} measurements were excluded. No significant associations were observed between {2D:4D} and the incidence of total hip replacement. Conclusion. A lower {2D:4D} is associated with an increased risk of severe knee {OA} requiring total knee replacement, but not the risk of severe hip {OA.} The underlying mechanisms for the association warrant further investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {Objective Ecologic and observational studies have suggested an association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25({OH)D)} levels and cardiovascular disease ({CVD)} risk factors, {CVD} mortality, and cancer mortality. Based on this, low serum 25({OH)D} levels should be associated with higher all-cause mortality in a general population. This hypothesis was tested in the present study. Design The Tromsø study is a longitudinal population-based multipurpose study initiated in 1974 with focus on lifestyle-related diseases. Our data are based on the fourth Tromsø study carried out in 1994–1995. Methods Information about death and cause of death was registered by obtaining information from the National Directory of Residents and the Death Cause Registry. Serum 25({OH)D} was measured in 7161 participants in the fourth Tromsø study. Results are presented for smokers (n=2410) and non-smokers (n=4751) separately as our immunoassay seems to overestimate 25({OH)D} levels for smokers. Results During a mean 11.7 years of follow-up, 1359 (19.0\%) participants died. In multivariate regression models, there was a significantly increased risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio ({HR)} 1.32, confidence interval ({CI)} 1.07–1.62) among non-smoking participants in the lowest 25({OH)D} quartile when compared with participants in the highest quartile. Equivalent results for smokers were not significant ({HR} 1.06, {CI} 0.83–1.35). Conclusions Low serum 25({OH)D} levels were associated with increased all-cause mortality for non-smokers, but the results did not reach statistical significance for smokers. However, low 25({OH)D} levels are known to be associated with impaired general health, and randomized controlled studies are needed to address the question of causality.},

  Abstract                 = {When dealing with large scale gene expression studies, observations are commonly contaminated by unwanted variation factors such as platforms or batches. Not taking this unwanted variation into account when analyzing the data can lead to spurious associations and to missing important signals. When the analysis is unsupervised, e.g., when the goal is to cluster the samples or to build a corrected version of the dataset - as opposed to the study of an observed factor of interest - taking unwanted variation into account can become a difficult task. The unwanted variation factors may be correlated with the unobserved factor of interest, so that correcting for the former can remove the latter if not done carefully. We show how negative control genes and replicate samples can be used to estimate unwanted variation in gene expression, and discuss how this information can be used to correct the expression data or build estimators for unsupervised problems. The proposed methods are then evaluated on three gene expression datasets. They generally manage to remove unwanted variation without losing the signal of interest and compare favorably to state of the art corrections.},

Mortality was ascertained on national databases up to December 2005, with a median time of follow up of 69·2 (range 1·0–79·9) months. Participants were divided into sex-specific quintiles of baseline levels for each nutrient, and hazard ratios were estimated with Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age and sex with the significance of linear trends in the associations assessed by logistic regression. There was no significant association between blood markers of Fe, vitamin B12 or folate status at baseline and mortality, but vitamin D status at baseline was inversely related to mortality (P for trend {\textless} 0·001). For vitamin C there was no evidence of a linear trend but participants in the lowest quintile of plasma levels had a significantly higher risk of death than those in the highest quintile. Randomized controlled trials of lifestyle changes which improve vitamin status are needed to assess whether these associations could be causal.},

By 2006, 899 lung cancer cases were identified and 1770 control participants were individually matched by country, sex, date of birth, and date of blood collection. Serum levels were measured for 6 factors of 1-carbon metabolism and {cotinine.Main} Outcome Measure Odds ratios ({ORs)} of lung cancer by serum levels of 4 B vitamins (B2, B6, folate [B9], and B12), methionine, and {homocysteine.Results} Within the entire {EPIC} cohort, the age-standardized incidence rates of lung cancer (standardized to the world population, aged 35-79 years) were 6.6, 44.9, and 156.1 per 100 000 person-years among never, former, and current smokers for men, respectively. The corresponding incidence rates for women were 7.1, 23.9, and 100.9 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. After accounting for smoking, a lower risk for lung cancer was seen for elevated serum levels of B6 (fourth vs first quartile {OR}, 0.44; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 0.33-0.60; P for trend {\textless}.000001), as well as for serum methionine (fourth vs first quartile {OR}, 0.52; 95\% {CI}, 0.39-0.69; P for trend {\textless}.000001). Similar and consistent decreases in risk were observed in never, former, and current smokers, indicating that results were not due to confounding by smoking. The magnitude of risk was also constant with increasing length of follow-up, indicating that the associations were not explained by preclinical disease. A lower risk was also seen for serum folate (fourth vs first quartile {OR}, 0.68; 95\% {CI}, 0.51-0.90; P for trend = .001), although this was apparent only for former and current smokers. When participants were classified by median levels of serum methionine and B6, having above-median levels of both was associated with a lower lung cancer risk overall ({OR}, 0.41; 95\% {CI}, 0.31-0.54), as well as separately among never ({OR}, 0.36; 95\% {CI}, 0.18-0.72), former ({OR}, 0.51; 95\% {CI}, 0.34-0.76), and current smokers ({OR}, 0.42; 95\% {CI}, 0.27-{0.65).Conclusion} Serum levels of vitamin B6 and methionine were inversely associated with risk of lung cancer.},

In this paper, we focus on this, and present an approach to estimation for certain ‘difficult’ situations associated with retrospective or incomplete prospective observation. The paper begins with the identification of some problem areas in the analysis of data on life history processes. We discuss maximum likelihood estimation in some simple contexts and introduce a pseudo-likelihood which enables the simple analysis of some sampling procedures. This approach is illustrated on standard retrospective and case-cohort designs.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous research relating lower socioeconomic status ({SES)} with poorer survival from colorectal cancer has varied in adjustment for confounding factors and in the use of individual-level or aggregate-level indicators of {SES.} We investigated the effect of {SES} and country of birth on survival from colorectal cancers diagnosed in participants of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. A total of 526 colorectal cancer cases diagnosed since baseline were followed from diagnosis to 1 June 2006 or death. Information on tumour site and stage, and treatments given were obtained from systematic medical record review. {SES} at diagnosis was assigned using both an area-based measure of social disadvantage and individual level of educational attainment. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios associated with socioeconomic disadvantage, educational attainment, and country of birth. During an average follow-up of 5.6 years from diagnosis, 230 deaths occurred, 197 from colorectal cancer. After adjusting for age, sex, tumour stage, waist circumference and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the hazard ratios of dying from all causes and from colorectal cancer associated with living in the least disadvantaged areas compared with most disadvantaged areas were 0.73 (95\% {CI} 0.53–1.00, p for trend = 0.06) and 0.80 (95\% {CI} 0.57–1.12, p for trend = 0.22) respectively. Further adjustment for hospital case-load, tumour characteristics, and lifestyle factors did not change the estimates materially. Level of educational attainment and country of birth were not independent predictors of the risk of dying from colorectal cancer. Despite a universal health care system in Australia, socioeconomic inequalities in survival from colorectal cancer exist, and an enduring challenge is to ensure that improvements in colorectal cancer survival are shared equally across the population.},

  Abstract                 = {In many large prospective cohorts, expensive exposure measurements cannot be obtained for all individuals. Exposure–disease association studies are therefore often based on nested case–control or case–cohort studies in which complete information is obtained only for sampled individuals. However, in the full cohort, there may be a large amount of information on cheaply available covariates and possibly a surrogate of the main exposure(s), which typically goes unused. We view the nested case–control or case–cohort study plus the remainder of the cohort as a full-cohort study with missing data. Hence, we propose using multiple imputation ({MI)} to utilise information in the full cohort when data from the sub-studies are analysed. We use the fully observed data to fit the imputation models. We consider using approximate imputation models and also using rejection sampling to draw imputed values from the true distribution of the missing values given the observed data. Simulation studies show that using {MI} to utilise full-cohort information in the analysis of nested case–control and case–cohort studies can result in important gains in efficiency, particularly when a surrogate of the main exposure is available in the full cohort. In simulations, this method outperforms counter-matching in nested case–control studies and a weighted analysis for case–cohort studies, both of which use some full-cohort information. Approximate imputation models perform well except when there are interactions or non-linear terms in the outcome model, where imputation using rejection sampling works well.

  Abstract                 = {Summary In a case–cohort design, covariates are assembled only for a subcohort that is randomly selected from the entire cohort and any additional cases outside the subcohort. This design is appealing for large cohort studies of rare disease, especially when the exposures of interest are expensive to ascertain for all the subjects. We propose statistical methods for analyzing the case–cohort data with a semiparametric accelerated failure time model that interprets the covariates effects as to accelerate or decelerate the time to failure. Asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators are developed. The finite sample properties of case–cohort estimator and its relative efficiency to full cohort estimator are assessed via simulation studies. A real example from a study of cardiovascular disease is provided to illustrate the estimating procedure.},

  Abstract                 = {Three genetic loci for lung cancer risk have been identified by genome-wide association studies ({GWAS)}, but inherited susceptibility to specific histologic types of lung cancer is not well established. We conducted a {GWAS} of lung cancer and its major histologic types, genotyping 515,922 single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs)} in 5739 lung cancer cases and 5848 controls from one population-based case-control study and three cohort studies. Results were combined with summary data from ten additional studies, for a total of 13,300 cases and 19,666 controls of European descent. Four studies also provided histology data for replication, resulting in 3333 adenocarcinomas ({AD)}, 2589 squamous cell carcinomas ({SQ)}, and 1418 small cell carcinomas ({SC).} In analyses by histology, rs2736100 ({TERT)}, on chromosome 5p15.33, was associated with risk of adenocarcinoma (odds ratio [{OR]} = 1.23, 95\% confidence interval [{CI]} = 1.13–1.33, p = 3.02 × 10−7), but not with other histologic types ({OR} = 1.01, p = 0.84 and {OR} = 1.00, p = 0.93 for {SQ} and {SC}, respectively). This finding was confirmed in each replication study and overall meta-analysis ({OR} = 1.24, 95\% {CI} = 1.17–1.31, p = 3.74 × 10−14 for {AD;} {OR} = 0.99, p = 0.69 and {OR} = 0.97, p = 0.48 for {SQ} and {SC}, respectively). Other previously reported association signals on 15q25 and 6p21 were also refined, but no additional loci reached genome-wide significance. In conclusion, a lung cancer {GWAS} identified a distinct hereditary contribution to adenocarcinoma.},

Asymptotic relative efficiency comparisons indicate that this type of sampling has superior efficiency to simple nested case-control sampling in situations of practical interest. A simple extension of the method is given which allows for nonrepresentative sampling of failures. Analysis of data from counter-matched studies may be performed using standard conditional logistic likelihood software which allows for an ‘offset’ in the model.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Numerous observational studies have found supplemental calcium and vitamin D to be associated with reduced risk of common cancers. However, interventional studies to test this effect are lacking. Objective: The purpose of this analysis was to determine the efficacy of calcium alone and calcium plus vitamin D in reducing incident cancer risk of all types. Design: This was a 4-y, population-based, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial. The primary outcome was fracture incidence, and the principal secondary outcome was cancer incidence. The subjects were 1179 community-dwelling women randomly selected from the population of healthy postmenopausal women aged {\textgreater}55 y in a 9-county rural area of Nebraska centered at latitude {41.4°N.} Subjects were randomly assigned to receive 1400–1500 mg supplemental calcium/d alone (Ca-only), supplemental calcium plus 1100 {IU} vitamin D3/d (Ca + D), or placebo. Results: When analyzed by intention to treat, cancer incidence was lower in the Ca + D women than in the placebo control subjects (P {\textless} 0.03). With the use of logistic regression, the unadjusted relative risks ({RR)} of incident cancer in the Ca + D and Ca-only groups were 0.402 (P = 0.01) and 0.532 (P = 0.06), respectively. When analysis was confined to cancers diagnosed after the first 12 mo, {RR} for the Ca + D group fell to 0.232 ({CI:} 0.09, 0.60; P {\textless} 0.005) but did not change significantly for the Ca-only group. In multiple logistic regression models, both treatment and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations were significant, independent predictors of cancer risk. Conclusions: Improving calcium and vitamin D nutritional status substantially reduces all-cancer risk in postmenopausal women. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as {NCT00352170.}},

  Abstract                 = {Fruit and vegetable consumption has been hypothesized to reduce the risk of renal cell cancer. We conducted a pooled analysis of 13 prospective studies, including 1,478 incident cases of renal cell cancer (709 women and 769 men) among 530,469 women and 244,483 men followed for up to 7 to 20 years. Participants completed a validated food-frequency questionnaire at baseline. Using the primary data from each study, the study-specific relative risks ({RR)} were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model and then pooled using a random effects model. We found that fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with a reduced risk of renal cell cancer. Compared with {\textless}200 g/d of fruit and vegetable intake, the pooled multivariate {RR} for ≥600 g/d was 0.68 [95\% confidence interval (95\% {CI)} = 0.54-0.87; P for between-studies heterogeneity = 0.86; P for trend = 0.001]. Compared with {\textless}100 g/d, the pooled multivariate {RRs} (95\% {CI)} for ≥400 g/d were 0.79 (0.63-0.99; P for trend = 0.03) for total fruit and 0.72 (0.48-1.08; P for trend = 0.07) for total vegetables. For specific carotenoids, the pooled multivariate {RRs} (95\% {CIs)} comparing the highest and lowest quintiles were 0.87 (0.73-1.03) for α-carotene, 0.82 (0.69-0.98) for β-carotene, 0.86 (0.73-1.01) for β-cryptoxanthin, 0.82 (0.64-1.06) for lutein/zeaxanthin, and 1.13 (0.95-1.34) for lycopene. In conclusion, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with decreasing risk of renal cell cancer; carotenoids present in fruit and vegetables may partly contribute to this protection.

In a simulation study, the authors compared 2 methods for imputation that are widely available in standard software: fully conditional specification ({FCS)} or “chained equations” and multivariate normal imputation ({MVNI).} The authors created data sets of 1,000 observations to simulate a cohort study, and missing data were induced under 3 missing-data mechanisms. Imputations were performed using {FCS} (Royston's “ice”) and {MVNI} (Schafer's {NORM)} in Stata (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas), with transformations or prediction matching being used to manage nonnormality in the continuous variables. Inferences for a set of regression parameters were compared between these approaches and a complete-case analysis. As expected, both {FCS} and {MVNI} were generally less biased than complete-case analysis, and both produced similar results despite the presence of binary and ordinal variables that clearly did not follow a normal distribution. Ignoring skewness in a continuous covariate led to large biases and poor coverage for the corresponding regression parameter under both approaches, although inferences for other parameters were largely unaffected. These results provide reassurance that similar results can be expected from {FCS} and {MVNI} in a standard regression analysis involving variously scaled variables.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The bioequivalence of the different forms of vitamin D, ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), has been questioned. Earlier studies have suggested that vitamin D2 is less biologically active than vitamin D3. Objective and Design: In a parallel study, we tested the effects of supplementation with 50-μg/d doses of vitamin D2 or D3 or a placebo over a period of 8 weeks on 25({OH)D2}, 25({OH)D3}, their sum 25({OH)D} (primary outcome variables), and {PTH} in healthy volunteers applying a double-blind, randomized study design. The study was conducted during the winter of 2012 in Halle (Saale), Germany, at latitude {51°47N}, when {UVB} irradiation is virtually absent. Blood samples for the determinations of vitamin D status and {PTH} were collected at baseline and after 4 and 8 weeks of supplementation. Results: In the placebo group (n = 19), 25({OH)D3} decreased from 39.4 ± 14.2 to 31.1 ± 12.4 {nmol/L} after 8 weeks (P {\textless} .01). In the vitamin D3 group (n = 42), the concentrations of 25({OH)D3} increased from 41.5 ± 22.8 {nmol/L} at baseline to 88.0 ± 22.1 {nmol/L} after 8 weeks (P {\textless} .01). In the group receiving vitamin D2 (n = 46), the 25({OH)D2} concentrations increased significantly, whereas the 25({OH)D3} concentration fell from 36.4 ± 13.3 {nmol/L} at baseline to 16.6 ± 6.3 {nmol/L} after 8 weeks (P {\textless} .01). The total 25({OH)D} was not different between the groups at baseline but differed significantly between the groups after 4 and 8 weeks (P {\textless} .001). Conclusions: Vitamin D3 increases the total 25({OH)D} concentration more than vitamin D2. Vitamin D2 supplementation was associated with a decrease in 25({OH)D3}, which can explain the different effect on total 25({OH)D.}},

  Abstract                 = {To compare temporal trends in the incidence and mortality of renal cell cancer among blacks and whites for clues to etiologic differences. We examined trends in age-adjusted and age-specific Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results incidence and {US} mortality rates for renal cancer for 1973 through 2007, as well as nephrectomy rates from surgery codes for kidney cancer for 2000 through 2007. For nearly four decades, incidence rates for renal cell cancer have been rising more rapidly among blacks than whites, leading to a shift in excess from among whites to among blacks, almost entirely accounted for by an excess of localized disease. The incidence patterns are puzzling, as localized renal cell cancer is primarily detected incidentally by imaging, to which blacks have historically had less access. In contrast to the incidence patterns, there has been an unexpected convergence of renal cancer mortality rates, which have been virtually identical among blacks and whites since the early 1990s. Nephrectomy rates, regardless of stage, were lower among blacks than among whites, despite almost identical cause-specific survival rates in both races. The identical mortality patterns, combined with higher and more rapidly increasing incidence and lower rates of nephrectomies among blacks, suggest that renal cell cancer may tend to be a less aggressive tumor in blacks. This hypothesis is supported by the favorable stage distribution among blacks and their higher survival for distant and unstaged cancer. Further research into the enigmatic descriptive epidemiology and the biology and natural history of renal cell cancer may shed light on the etiology of this malignancy and its more frequent occurrence among black Americans., (C) 2011 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {A major challenge in cancer epidemiologic studies, especially those of rare cancers, is observing enough cases. To address this, researchers often join forces by bringing multiple studies together to achieve large sample sizes, allowing for increased power in hypothesis testing, and improved efficiency in effect estimation. Combining studies, however, renders the analysis difficult owing to the presence of heterogeneity in the pooled data. In this article, motivated by a collaborative nested case–control ({NCC)} study of ovarian cancer in three cohorts from United States, Sweden, and Italy, we investigate the use of penalty regularized partial likelihood estimation in the context of pooled {NCC} studies to achieve two goals. First, we propose an adaptive group lasso ({gLASSO)} penalized approach to simultaneously identify important variables and estimate their effects. Second, we propose a composite {agLASSO} penalized approach to identify variables with heterogeneous effects. Both methods are readily implemented with the group coordinate gradient decent algorithm and shown to enjoy the oracle property. We conduct simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our proposed approaches in finite samples under various heterogeneity settings, and apply them to the pooled ovarian cancer study.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary Nested case–control ({NCC)} design is a popular sampling method in large epidemiological studies for its cost effectiveness to investigate the temporal relationship of diseases with environmental exposures or biological precursors. Thomas' maximum partial likelihood estimator is commonly used to estimate the regression parameters in Cox's model for {NCC} data. In this article, we consider a situation in which failure/censoring information and some crude covariates are available for the entire cohort in addition to {NCC} data and propose an improved estimator that is asymptotically more efficient than Thomas' estimator. We adopt a projection approach that, heretofore, has only been employed in situations of random validation sampling and show that it can be well adapted to {NCC} designs where the sampling scheme is a dynamic process and is not independent for controls. Under certain conditions, consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator are established and a consistent variance estimator is also developed. Furthermore, a simplified approximate estimator is proposed when the disease is rare. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of our proposed estimators and to compare the efficiency with Thomas' estimator and other competing estimators. Moreover, sensitivity analyses are conducted to demonstrate the behavior of the proposed estimator when model assumptions are violated, and we find that the biases are reasonably small in realistic situations. We further demonstrate the proposed method with data from studies on Wilms' tumor.},

  Abstract                 = {Context: Most studies examining associations between circulating vitamin D and disease are based on a single measure of vitamin D, which may not reflect levels over time, particularly because vitamin D concentrations vary by season. Few studies evaluated how well multiple 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25({OH)D]} measures track within the same individual over time. Objective: This study examined variability and reproducibility of vitamin D by evaluating repeat measurements of plasma 25({OH)D} concentrations while accounting for determinants of circulating concentrations including dietary supplement use and latitude of residence from a population of {U.S.} radiologic technologists. Design and Participants: We analyzed circulating 25({OH)D} in blood samples taken from 538 men and women from a prospective, nationwide study at two time points within a 1-yr period, most measured in different seasons. Inter- and intra-individual variability, reliability coefficients, and measurement error were examined. Results: The spearman rank correlation between two measurements of 25({OH)D} concentrations was moderate (r = 0.75, P {\textless} 0.001) and did not vary significantly by participant characteristics including age, race, or latitude. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.72 (95\% confidence interval = 0.68–0.76). The deattenuation factor of plasma 25({OH)D} levels was 1.39, suggesting that a single measure of vitamin D on a continuous scale in regression analyses may result in attenuated relationships of about 40\%. Conclusion: Our results suggest that a single blood sample obtained in spring or fall provides a reasonable average for 25({OH)D} over a 1-yr period, but additional studies are needed to estimate variability and agreement in plasma 25({OH)D} measurements over longer intervals and younger populations.},

  Abstract                 = {Background  In patients undergoing dialysis, therapy with calcitriol or paricalcitol or other vitamin D agents is associated with reduced mortality. Observational data suggests that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels (25[{OH]D)} are associated with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and cancers. However, whether low serum 25({OH)D} levels are associated with mortality in the general population is {unknown.Methods} We tested the association of low 25({OH)D} levels with all-cause, cancer, and cardiovascular disease ({CVD)} mortality in 13 331 nationally representative adults 20 years or older from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ({NHANES} {III)} linked mortality files. Participant vitamin D levels were collected from 1988 through 1994, and individuals were passively followed for mortality through {2000.Results} In cross-sectional multivariate analyses, increasing age, female sex, nonwhite race/ethnicity, diabetes, current smoking, and higher body mass index were all independently associated with higher odds of 25({OH)D} deficiency (lowest quartile of 25({OH)D} level, {\textless}17.8 {ng/mL} [to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496]), while greater physical activity, vitamin D supplementation, and nonwinter season were inversely associated. During a median 8.7 years of follow-up, there were 1806 deaths, including 777 from {CVD.} In multivariate models (adjusted for baseline demographics, season, and traditional and novel {CVD} risk factors), compared with the highest quartile, being in the lowest quartile (25[{OH]D} levels {\textless}17.8 {ng/mL)} was associated with a 26\% increased rate of all-cause mortality (mortality rate ratio, 1.26; 95\% {CI}, 1.08-1.46) and a population attributable risk of 3.1\%. The adjusted models of {CVD} and cancer mortality revealed a higher risk, which was not statistically {significant.Conclusion} The lowest quartile of 25({OH)D} level ({\textless}17.8 {ng/mL)} is independently associated with all-cause mortality in the general population.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Vitamin D status is known to be important for bone health but may also affect the development of several chronic diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, which are 2 major causes of death. Objective: We aimed to examine how vitamin D status relates to overall and cause-specific mortality. Design: The Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men, a community-based cohort of elderly men (mean age at baseline: 71 y; n = 1194), was used to investigate the association between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25({OH)D]} and mortality. Total plasma 25({OH)D} was determined with {HPLC} atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry. Proportional hazards regression was used to compute hazard ratios ({HRs).} Results: During follow-up (median: 12.7 y), 584 (49\%) participants died. There was a U-shaped association between vitamin D concentrations and total mortality. An approximately 50\% higher total mortality rate was observed among men in the lowest 10\% ({\textless}46 {nmol/L)} and the highest 5\% ({\textgreater}98 {nmol/L)} of plasma 25({OH)D} concentrations compared with intermediate concentrations. Cancer mortality was also higher at low plasma concentrations (multivariable-adjusted {HR:} 2.20; 95\% {CI:} 1.44, 3.38) and at high concentrations ({HR:} 2.64; 95\% {CI:} 1.46, 4.78). For cardiovascular death, only low ({HR:} 1.89; 95\% {CI:} 1.21, 2.96) but not high ({HR:} 1.33; 95\% {CI:} 0.69, 2.54) concentrations indicated higher risk. Conclusions: Both high and low concentrations of plasma 25({OH)D} are associated with elevated risks of overall and cancer mortality. Low concentrations are associated with cardiovascular mortality.},

  Abstract                 = {Vitamins B2 and B6 serve as cofactors in enzymatic reactions involved in tryptophan and homocysteine metabolism. Plasma concentrations of these vitamins and amino acids are related to smoking and inflammation, and correlate with other markers of immune activation. Large-scale studies of these relations have been hampered by lack of suitable analytical methods. The assay described includes riboflavin, five vitamin B6 forms (pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, pyridoxal, 4-pyridoxic acid, pyridoxine and pyridoxamine), tryptophan and six tryptophan metabolites (kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine, xanthurenic acid and 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid), cystathionine, neopterin and cotinine. Trichloroacetic acid containing 13 isotope-labelled internal standards was added to 60 {µL} of plasma, the mixture was centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant used for analysis. The analytes were separated within 5 min on a stable-bond C8 column by a gradient-type mobile phase containing acetonitrile, heptafluorobutyric acid and high concentration (650 {mmol/L)} of acetic acid, and detected using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry ({ESI-MS/MS).} The mobile phase ensured sufficient separation and high ionization efficiency of all analytes. Recoveries were 75–123\% and within-day and between-day coefficients of variance ({CVs)} were 2.5–9.5\% and 5.4–16.9\%, respectively. Limits of detection ranged from 0.05 to 7 {nmol/L.} The method enables quantification of endogenous plasma concentrations of 16 analytes related to B-vitamin status and inflammation, and may prove useful in large-scale epidemiological studies.

All sample handling is performed by a robotic workstation. The assay uses 45 {μL} of plasma, and sample treatment consists of protein precipitation by trichloroacetic acid. The analytes were separated on a Fortis Phenyl column using an isocratic mobile phase that contained water, methanol and acetic acid. Methionine, methionine sulfoxide, choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, arginine, asymmetric dimethylarginine, symmetric dimethylarginine, homoarginine, creatinine, cystathionine and trimethyllysine all showed limits of detection well below the 5th percentile of plasma distributions in healthy humans, coefficients of variation were in the range 2.2–12.3 \%, and recoveries were 80–131 \%. Simple sample processing, low-volume consumption, multiplexing and high capacity/short run time of this method make it suitable for large-scale metabolic profiling of precious biobank samples.},

  Abstract                 = {It is unclear whether reduced plasma pyridoxal 5′-phosphate ({PLP)} during inflammation reflects an altered distribution or increased requirement of vitamin B-6 that may impair overall vitamin B-6 status in tissues. In plasma from 3035 patients undergoing coronary angiography for suspected coronary heart disease, we investigated if plasma concentrations of any metabolites in the kynurenine pathway, which depend on {PLP} as cofactor, may serve as metabolic marker(s) of vitamin B-6 status. We also examined the association of vitamin B-6 status with serum or plasma concentrations of several inflammatory markers. Among the kynurenines, only 3-hydroxykynurenine ({HK)} was inversely related to {PLP} and showed a positive relation to 4 investigated inflammatory markers. A segmented relationship was observed between {PLP} and {HK}, with a steep slope at {PLP} concentrations {\textless} 18.4 {nmol/L}, corresponding to the 5th percentile, and an almost zero slope at higher {PLP} concentrations. Low {PLP} and the steep {PLP-HK} slope were essentially confined to participants with 1 or more inflammatory markers in the upper tertile. Oral supplementation with pyridoxine hydrochloride (40 mg/d) for 1 mo increased plasma {PLP} 8-fold, reduced the geometric mean (95\% {CI)} of {HK} from 29.5 to 20.2 {nmol/L} (P {\textless} 0.001), and abolished the steep segment of the {PLP-HK} curve. The steep inverse relationship of plasma {PLP} with {HK} at low plasma {PLP} and the lowering of {HK} by pyridoxine suggest plasma {HK} as a metabolic marker of vitamin B-6 status. Thus, low plasma {PLP} during inflammation may reflect impaired cellular vitamin B-6 status, as indicated by the concurrent increase in plasma {HK.}},

This suggests that low 25-hydroxyvitamin D status, due to lower levels of {UVB} irradiance, and energy from animal sources might be involved in etiology. The association of latitude with age-adjusted incidence rates was determined for all 175 countries in a {UN} cancer database, {GLOBOCAN.} The independent association of {UVB} irradiance, cloud cover and intake of calories from animal sources with age-adjusted incidence rates was assessed using multiple regression in 139 countries that provided dietary data. Renal cancer incidence rates were highest in countries situated at the highest latitudes, in men (R2 = 0.64, p {\textless} 0.01) and women (R2 = 0.63, p {\textless} 0.01). According to multivariate analysis in men, {UVB} irradiance was inversely associated with renal cancer incidence rates (p = 0.0003), while cloud cover (p = 0.003) and intake of calories from animal sources (p {\textless} 0.0001) were independently positively associated (R2 for model = 0.73, p {\textless} 0.0001).

  Abstract                 = {Cell culture experiments suggest that vitamin D may inhibit renal carcinogenesis, but human studies of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25({OH)D)}, the accepted measure of vitamin D status, and kidney cancer have been null. Limited research has examined the role of circulating vitamin D binding protein ({DBP)} in the association between 25({OH)D} and disease risk, and it is unclear whether free 25({OH)D} in circulation is a better measure of effective exposure, or if {DBP} may independently impact outcomes. We conducted a nested case-control analysis within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention ({ATBC)} Study to examine whether circulating {DBP} concentration was prospectively associated with risk of renal cell carcinoma, and whether it modified the association with 25({OH)D.} Renal cell carcinoma cases (n=262) were matched 1:1 to controls on age (± 1 year) and date of blood collection (± 30 days). We estimated odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals of renal cell carcinoma risk by quartiles of 25({OH)D}, {DBP}, and the molar ratio of 25({OH)D:DBP}, a proxy for free circulating 25({OH)D.} Men with higher {DBP} concentrations were at significantly decreased risk of kidney cancer (Q4 vs. Q1: {OR=0.17}, 95\% {CI=0.08–0.33;} p-trend{\textless}0.0001), a finding unchanged by adjustment for 25({OH)D.} Although we observed no association with total 25({OH)D}, we found slightly increased risk with higher levels of estimated free 25({OH)D} (Q4 vs. Q1 of the 25({OH)D:DBP} ratio, {OR=1.61}, 95\% {CI=0.95–2.73;} p-trend=0.09). The strong protective association observed between higher circulating {DBP} concentration and kidney cancer risk requires replication but suggests a vitamin D-independent influence of {DBP.} © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: We aimed to assess whether {2D} : {4D} measures are associated with breast cancer risk. Methods: We derived the ratio of the lengths of the index and ring fingers ({2D} : {4D)}, and right minus left {2D} : {4D} (Δr−l) from digit lengths measured from photocopies of participants’ hands collected during a recent follow-up of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, a prospective study including 24 469 women. Of the 9044 women with available data, we identified 573 incident breast cancer cases. Hazard ratios ({HR)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CI)} for a one standard deviation difference in {2D} : {4D} measures were obtained from Weibull survival models, and linear regression models were used to examine potential associations between {2D} : {4D} measures and age at menarche and menopause. Results: We found a direct association between left {2D} : {4D} and breast cancer risk, an inverse association between Δr−l and risk of breast cancer, but no association between right {2D} : {4D} and breast cancer risk. Among breast cancer cases, both right {2D} : {4D} and Δr−l were inversely associated with age at diagnosis. We also observed associations between both right {2D} : {4D} and Δr−l and age at menopause, with increasing digit ratio measures related to earlier mean age at menopause. Conclusion: Digit ratio measures might be associated with breast cancer risk and age at onset of breast cancer. If confirmed in other studies, this suggests that lower exposure or sensitivity to prenatal testosterone might be associated with lower risk of breast cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Both prostate cancer and androgenetic alopecia are strongly age-related conditions that are considered to be androgen dependent, but studies of the relationship between them have yielded inconsistent results. We aimed to assess whether androgenetic alopecia at ages 20 and 40 years are associated with risk of prostate cancer. Methods: At a follow-up of the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, men were asked to assess their hair pattern at ages 20 and 40 years relative to eight categories in showcards. Cases were men notified to the Victorian Cancer Registry with prostate cancer diagnosed between cohort enrollment (1990–1994) and follow-up attendance (2003–2009). Flexible parametric survival models were used to estimate age-varying {HRs} and predicted cumulative probabilities of prostate cancer by androgenetic alopecia categories. Results: Of 9,448 men that attended follow-up and provided data on androgenetic alopecia, we identified 476 prostate cancer cases during a median follow-up of 11 years four months. Cumulative probability of prostate cancer was greater at all ages up to 76 years, for men with vertex versus no androgenetic alopecia at age of 40 years. At age of 76 years, the estimated probabilities converged to 0.15. Vertex androgenetic alopecia at 40 years was also associated with younger age of diagnosis for prostate cancer cases. Conclusions: Vertex androgenetic alopecia at age of 40 years might be a marker of increased risk of early-onset prostate cancer. Impact: If confirmed, these results suggest that the apparently conflicting findings of previous studies might be explained by failure to adequately model the age-varying nature of the association between androgenetic alopecia and prostate cancer.

We prospectively investigated associations between empirically derived dietary patterns and prostate cancer risk using the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study. We followed 14,627 men of ages 34 to 75 years for an average of 13.6 years, and identified 1,018 incident prostate cancers. Factor analysis of the 121-item food frequency questionnaire identified four factors with eigenvalues {\textgreater}2 that explained 67\% of the total variance. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we found no association between any dietary pattern and prostate cancer risk overall (all Ptrend ≥ 0.2). The hazard ratios for quartiles of the dietary pattern scores ranged from 0.87 to 1.14 and all 95\% confidence intervals included 1. The analyses by aggressiveness, Gleason score groups, and age at diagnosis did not show any association (all Ptrend {\textgreater} 0.07). (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2009;18(11):3126–9)},

  Abstract                 = {We studied the effect of vitamin D compounds on the growth of the human renal carcinoma cell line ({KU-2)} and discovered a receptor protein specific for the active form of vitamin D3, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The {KU-2} cell line was established from a pulmonary metastasis of renal cell carcinoma in a patient with hyperhemoglobinemia. The cells were tumorigenic in nude mice and clonogenic in a soft agar culture. Vitamin D3 derivatives suppressed proliferation of {KU-2} cells in a monolayer culture and also clonogenicity in a soft agar culture dose-dependently. Of the vitamin D3 derivatives tested, 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was the most potent in inhibiting cell growth, followed successively by 1 {alpha,24R},25-trihydroxyvitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and {24R},25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in that order. Analysis of the cell cycle phase of treated and non-treated {KU-2} cells revealed that the action of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was not phase-specific but simply extended the doubling time of the cells. Radioreceptor assay and sucrose density gradient analysis of the cytosol showed that {KU-2} cells contained a {3.2S} receptor protein to which 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was specifically bound (Kd = 20.8 +/- 4.8 {pM}, Nmax = 87 +/- 24 fmole/mg protein, 4000 molecules/cell). On the other hand, the equilibrium dissociation constant of internalization of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Kint) by intact {KU-2} cells was 1.2 {nM} and the internalizing capacity was 33 fmole/8 X 10(6) cells (2500 molecules/cell) in the 10\% serum medium, which was the same as that used in the growth study.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 250 {WORDS)}},

  Abstract                 = {Aim: Biological and epidemiologic data suggest that 1 alpha, 25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25({OH)2D3)} levels may influence development of renal cell carcinoma. The vitamin D receptor ({VDR)} is a crucial mediator for the cellular effects of 1,25({OH)2D3} and additionally interacts with other cell signaling pathways that influence cancer progression. {VDR} gene polymorphisms may play an important role in risk of incidence for various malignant tumors. This study investigated whether {VDR} gene polymorphisms were associated with increased risk and prognosis of renal cell carcinoma ({RCC)} in a Japanese {population.Methods:} To analyze risk of {RCC} depending on {VDR} polymorphism, a case–control association study was performed. The {VDR} gene polymorphisms at three locations, {BsmI}, {ApaI} and {TaqI}, were genotyped in 135 {RCC} patients and 150 controls in a Japanese population. Logistic regression models were used to assess the genetic effects on {prognosis.Results:} Significant differences in the {ApaI} genotype were observed between {RCC} patients and controls (χ2 = 6.90, P = 0.032). No statistical significant difference was found in the {BsmI} and {TaqI} polymorphisms. The frequency of the {AA} genotype in the {ApaI} polymorphism was significantly higher in the {RCC} patients than in the controls (odds ratio, 2.59; 95\% confidence intervals, 1.21–5.55; P = 0.012). Multivariate regression analysis showed that the {AA} genotype was an independent prognostic factor for cause-specific survival (relative risk 3.3; P = {0.038).Conclusion:} The {AA} genotype at the {ApaI} site of the {VDR} gene may be a risk of incidence and poor prognosis factor for {RCC} in the Japanese population. Additional studies with a large sample size and investigation of the functional significance of the {ApaI} polymorphism in {RCC} cells are warranted.},

The aim of our study was to elucidate whether low serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25({OH)D]} are associated with an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular {mortality.Design} and patients The Hoorn Study is a prospective population-based study among older men and {women.Measurements} Fasting serum 25({OH)D} was determined in 614 study participants at the follow-up visit in 2000–2001, the baseline for the present analysis. To account for sex differences and seasonal variations of 25({OH)D} levels we formed sex-specific quartiles, which were calculated from the 25({OH)D} values of each {season.Results} After a mean follow-up period of 6·2 years, 51 study participants died including 20 deaths due to cardiovascular causes. Unadjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios ({HRs;} with 95\% confidence intervals) for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in the first when compared with the upper three 25({OH)D} quartiles were 2·24 (1·28–3·92; P = 0·005) and 4·78 (1·95–11·69; P = 0·001), respectively. After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, arterial hypertension, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, glomerular filtration rate and waist-to-hip ratio, the {HRs} remained significant for all-cause [1·97 (1·08–3·58; P = 0·027)] and for cardiovascular mortality [5·38 (2·02–14·34; P = {0·001)].Conclusions} Low 25({OH)D} levels are associated with all-cause mortality and even more pronounced with cardiovascular mortality, but it remains unclear whether vitamin D deficiency is a cause or a consequence of a poor health status. Therefore, intervention studies are warranted to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation reduces mortality and cardiovascular diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Tryptophan catabolism in cancer is increasingly being recognized as an important microenvironmental factor that suppresses antitumor immune responses. It has been proposed that the essential amino acid tryptophan is catabolized in the tumor tissue by the rate-limiting enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase ({IDO)} expressed in tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells. This metabolic pathway creates an immunosuppressive milieu in tumors and in tumor-draining lymph nodes by inducing T-cell anergy and apoptosis through depletion of tryptophan and accumulation of immunosuppressive tryptophan catabolites. Competitive inhibitors of {IDO} are currently being tested in clinical trials in patients with solid cancer, with the aim of enhancing the efficacy of conventional chemotherapy. There are, however, certain tumor types that are capable of catabolizing tryptophan but are largely {IDO-negative.} Recent evidence from studies in malignant gliomas and other types of cancers points to alternative enzymatic pathways of tryptophan catabolism involving tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase ({TDO).} {TDO}, which is considered responsible for regulating systemic tryptophan levels in the liver, is constitutively expressed in some cancers and is equally capable of suppressing antitumor immune responses. Depletion of tryptophan induces signaling events in T cells, leading to anergy and apoptosis; however, active immunomodulation by accumulating tryptophan catabolites, most notably kynurenine, appears to play an equally important role. These immunomodulatory effects of kynurenine are mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. This intracellular transcription factor has classically been viewed as a receptor for environmental toxins, such as dioxin, and its important role in influencing immune responses, especially in epithelial barriers, is only beginning to emerge. This review summarizes the exciting developments in our understanding of tryptophan catabolism as a key factor in the immunobiology of cancer. Cancer Res; 72(21); 5435–40. ©2012 {AACR.}},

Risk factors for renal cell carcinoma included increasing age, increasing weight (either current, maximum adult weight, or weight at ages 18, 30, or 50 years), greater waist-to-hip ratio, and a history of blood transfusion. Total dietary calcium was associated independently with a reduced risk of renal cell carcinoma. No other dietary micro- or macronutrients or food groups were predictive of the development of renal cell carcinoma. Other previously identified risk factors were not confirmed: most notably, there was no increased risk from a history of hypertension, after adjustment for diuretic use. History of ever-use of diuretics was associated with a twofold increased risk of renal cancer, although the strength of association was markedly reduced after adjustment for age, weight, waist-to-hip ratio, and calcium intake., (C) Lippincott-Raven Publishers.},

  Abstract                 = {Case-control studies generally suggesting an inverse association between sun exposure and non-Hodgkin lymphoma ({NHL)} have led to speculation that vitamin D may protect against lymphomagenesis. To examine this hypothesis, the authors conducted a pooled investigation of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25({OH)D)} and subsequent {NHL} risk within 10 cohorts participating in the Cohort Consortium Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers. The authors analyzed measurements from 1,353 cases and 1,778 controls using conditional logistic regression and other methods to estimate the association of 25({OH)D} with {NHL.} No clear evidence of association between categories of 25({OH)D} concentration and {NHL} was observed overall (Ptrend = 0.68) or by sex (men, Ptrend = 0.50; women, Ptrend = 0.16). Findings for other measures (continuous log(25({OH)D)}, categories of 25({OH)D} using sex-/cohort-/season-specific quartiles as cutpoints, categories of season-adjusted residuals of predicted 25({OH)D} using quartiles as cutpoints) were generally null, although some measures of increasing 25({OH)D} were suggestive of an increased risk for women. Results from stratified analyses and investigations of histologic subtypes of {NHL} were also null. These findings do not support the hypothesis that elevated circulating 25({OH)D} concentration is associated with a reduced risk of {NHL.} Future research investigating the biologic basis for the {sunlight–NHL} association should consider alternative mechanisms, such as immunologic effects.},

Two loci on the regions of 2p21 and 11q13.3 were associated with {RCC} susceptibility below genome-wide significance. Two correlated variants (r2 = 0.99 in controls), rs11894252 (P = 1.8 × 10−8) and rs7579899 (P = 2.3 × 10−9), map to {EPAS1} on 2p21, which encodes hypoxia-inducible-factor-2 alpha, a transcription factor previously implicated in {RCC.} The second locus, rs7105934, at 11q13.3, contains no characterized genes (P = 7.8 × 10−14). In addition, we observed a promising association on 12q24.31 for rs4765623, which maps to {SCARB1}, the scavenger receptor class B, member 1 gene (P = 2.6 × 10−8). Our study reports previously unidentified genomic regions associated with {RCC} risk that may lead to new etiological insights.},

  Abstract                 = {The Liverpool Lung Project ({LLP)} has previously developed a risk model for prediction of 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer based on five epidemiologic risk factors. {SEZ6L}, a {Met430IIe} polymorphic variant found on 22q12.2 region, has been previously linked with an increased risk of lung cancer in a case-control population. In this article, we quantify the improvement in risk prediction with addition of {SEZ6L} to the {LLP} risk model. Data from 388 {LLP} subjects genotyped for {SEZ6L} single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP)} were combined with epidemiologic risk factors. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to predict 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer with and without this {SNP.} The improvement in the model associated with the {SEZ6L} {SNP} was assessed through pairwise comparison of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the net reclassification improvements ({NRI).} The extended model showed better calibration compared with the baseline model. There was a statistically significant modest increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve when {SEZ6L} was added into the baseline model. The {NRI} also revealed a statistically significant improvement of around 12\% for the extended model; this improvement was better for subjects classified into the two intermediate-risk categories by the baseline model ({NRI}, 27\%). Our results suggest that the addition of {SEZ6L} improved the performance of the {LLP} risk model, particularly for subjects whose initial absolute risks were unable to discriminate into “low-risk” or “high-risk” group. This work shows an approach to incorporate genetic biomarkers in risk models for predicting an individual's lung cancer risk. Cancer Prev Res; 3(5); 664–9. ©2010 {AACR.}},

  Abstract                 = {Background: External validation of existing lung cancer risk predic-tion models is limited. Using such models in clinical practice to guide the referral of patients for computed tomography ({CT)} screening for lung cancer depends on external validation and evi-dence of predicted clinical benefit. Objective: To evaluate the discrimination of the Liverpool Lung Project ({LLP)} risk model and demonstrate its predicted benefit for stratifying patients for {CT} screening by using data from 3 indepen-dent studies from Europe and North America. Design: Case-control and prospective cohort study. Setting: Europe and North America. Patients: Participants in the European Early Lung Cancer ({EUELC)} and Harvard case-control studies and the {LLP} population-based prospective cohort ({LLPC)} study. Measurements: 5-year absolute risks for lung cancer predicted by the {LLP} model. Results: The {LLP} risk model had good discrimination in both the Harvard (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve [{AUC]}, 0.76 [95\% Cl, 0.75 to 0.78]) and the {LLPC} ({AUC}, 0.82 [Cl, 0.80 to 0.85]) studies and modest discrimination in the {EUELC} ({AUC}, 0.67 [Cl, 0.64 to 0.69]) study. The decision utility analysis, which incorporates the harms and benefit of using a risk model to make clinical decisions, indicates that the {LLP} risk model performed better than smoking duration or family history alone in stratifying high-risk patients for lung cancer {CT} screening. Limitations: The model cannot assess whether including other risk factors, such as lung function or genetic markers, would improve accuracy. Lack of information on asbestos exposure in the {LLPC} limited the ability to validate the complete {LLP} risk model. Conclusion: Validation of the {LLP} risk model in 3 independent external data sets demonstrated good discrimination and evidence of predicted benefits for stratifying patients for lung cancer {CT} screening. Further studies are needed to prospectively evaluate model performance and evaluate the optimal population risk thresholds for initiating lung cancer screening.

  Abstract                 = {The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition ({EPIC)} is an ongoing multi-centre prospective cohort study designed to investigate the relationship between nutrition and cancer, with the potential for studying other diseases as well. The study currently includes 519 978 participants (366 521 women and 153 457 men, mostly aged 35–70 years) in 23 centres located in 10 European countries, to be followed for cancer incidence and cause-specific mortality for several decades. At enrolment, which took place between 1992 and 2000 at each of the different centres, information was collected through a non-dietary questionnaire on lifestyle variables and through a dietary questionnaire addressing usual diet. Anthropometric measurements were performed and blood samples taken, from which plasma, serum, red cells and buffy coat fractions were separated and aliquoted for long-term storage, mostly in liquid nitrogen. To calibrate dietary measurements, a standardised, computer-assisted 24-hour dietary recall was implemented at each centre on stratified random samples of the participants, for a total of 36 900 subjects. {EPIC} represents the largest single resource available today world-wide for prospective investigations on the aetiology of cancers (and other diseases) that can integrate questionnaire data on lifestyle and diet, biomarkers of diet and of endogenous metabolism (e.g. hormones and growth factors) and genetic polymorphisms. First results of case–control studies nested within the cohort are expected early in 2003. The present paper provides a description of the {EPIC} study, with the aim of simplifying reference to it in future papers reporting substantive or methodological studies carried out in the {EPIC} cohort.},

  Abstract                 = {In most randomized clinical trials ({RCTs)} with a right-censored time-to-event outcome, the hazard ratio is taken as an appropriate measure of the effectiveness of a new treatment compared with a standard-of-care or control treatment. However, it has long been known that the hazard ratio is valid only under the proportional hazards ({PH)} assumption. This assumption is formally checked only rarely. Some recent trials, particularly the {IPASS} trial in lung cancer and the {ICON7} trial in ovarian cancer, have alerted researchers to the possibility of gross non-{PH}, raising the critical question of how such data should be analyzed. Here, we propose the use of the restricted mean survival time at a prespecified, fixed time point as a useful general measure to report the difference between two survival curves. We describe different methods of estimating it and we illustrate its application to three {RCTs} in cancer. The examples are graded from a trial in kidney cancer in which there is no evidence of non-{PH}, to {IPASS}, where the opposite is clearly the case. We propose a simple, general scheme for the analysis of data from such {RCTs.} Key elements of our approach are Andersen's method of ‘pseudo-observations,’ which is based on the {Kaplan–Meier} estimate of the survival function, and Royston and Parmar's class of flexible parametric survival models, which may be used for analyzing data in the presence or in the absence of {PH} of the treatment effect.

  Abstract                 = {Modelling of censored survival data is almost always done by Cox proportional-hazards regression. However, use of parametric models for such data may have some advantages. For example, non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Suppose a nested case–control design has been applied for collecting covariate data when studying a specific disease. With possible new outcomes of interest it would be sensible to utilize the previously selected control group instead of (or in addition to) a new control selection, given that the same covariate data were relevant and available, and that their measurements had adequate stability and quality. We formulate this problem in the framework of the competing risks survival model. In this approach covariate information collected for all outcomes can be utilized in the analysis. We not only propose likelihood-based parameter estimation but we also review alternative methods based on weighted partial/pseudolikelihoods. The methods discussed here are closely related to the analysis of a case–cohort design, where the control group is not tied to cases of a specific disease. The different methods are compared in a simulation study. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Our objective was to examine the association between plasma {PLP} and multiple markers of inflammation in a community-based cohort [n = 2229 participants (55\% women, mean age 61 ± 9 y)]. We created an overall inflammation score ({IS)} as the sum of standardized values of 13 individual inflammatory markers. Multivariable-adjusted regression analysis was used to assess the associations between the {IS} and plasma {PLP.} Geometric mean plasma {PLP} concentrations were lower in the highest tertile category of {IS} relative to the lowest (61 vs. 80 {nmol/L;} P-trend {\textless} 0.0001). Similarly, the prevalence of {PLP} insufficiency was significantly higher for participants in the highest compared with the lowest tertiles for {IS} categories. These relationships persisted after accounting for vitamin B-6 intake. Also, there were significant inverse relationships between plasma {PLP} and 4 {IS} based on functionally related markers, including acute phase reactants, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and oxidative stress. In addition, secondary analyses revealed that many of the individual inflammatory markers were inversely associated with plasma {PLP} after adjusting for plasma C-reactive protein concentration. This study, in combination with past findings, further supports our hypothesis that inflammation is associated with a functional deficiency of vitamin B-6. We discuss 2 possible roles for {PLP} in the inflammatory process, including tryptophan metabolism and serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Many epidemiological studies use a nested case–control ({NCC)} design to reduce cost while maintaining study power. However, because of the incidence density sampling used, reusing data from {NCC} studies for analysis of secondary outcomes is not straightforward. Recent methodological developments have opened the possibility for prior {NCC} data to be used to complement controls in a current study, thereby improving study efficiency. However, practical guidelines on the effectiveness of prior data relative to newly sampled subjects and the potential power gains are still lacking. Using simulated cohorts, we show in this paper how the efficiency of {NCC} studies that use a mixture of prior and newly sampled subjects depends on the number of newly sampled controls and prior subjects as well as the overlap in the distributions of the matching variables. We explore the feasibility and efficiency of a current study that gathers no controls, relying instead on prior data. Using the concept of effective number of controls, we show how researchers can assess the potential power gains from reusing prior data. We apply the method to analyses of anorexia and contralateral breast cancer in the Swedish population and show how power calculations can be done using publicly available software. This work has important applications in genetic and molecular epidemiology to make optimal use of costly exposure measurements. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper it is observed that conditional inclusion probabilities of ever being included in the nested case-control study can be obtained, where conditioning is on the information needed to carry out a nested case-control study. The inclusion probabilities are used in pseudolikelihoods by weighting the individual log-likelihood contributions by their inverse. This makes it possible to fit parametric regression models. Also a new semiparametric estimator is obtained under the proportional-hazard model. The methods are illustrated by simulation experiments and by application to a dataset.},

Our knowledge of these two cancers, however, indicates that they have strikingly different etiology. A number of important occupational, lifestyle and genetic factors have been implicated in bladder carcinogenesis, which have greatly increased our understanding of this disease. In some instances, identification of these factors has contributed to the prevention or reduction of exposure to bladder carcinogens. Conversely, the etiology of kidney cancer is less well elucidated, which limits the possibilities for reducing its incidence by this approach. It is likely that much remains to be uncovered about the causes of these two cancers, and these advances will increase our appreciation of the biology of these cancers and perhaps lead to further possibilities for their prevention.

Standard errors are estimated by a numerical profile likelihood approach based on {EM} aided differentiation. The work was motivated by a nested case‐control study that hypothesized that insulin‐like growth factor I was associated with ischemic heart disease. The study was based on a population of 3784 Danes and 231 cases of ischemic heart disease where controls were matched on age and gender. We illustrate the use of the {MLE} for these data and show how the maximum likelihood framework can be used to obtain information additional to the relative risk estimates of covariates.},

Objective: We aimed to conduct a repeated-measurements analysis on the association of serum 25({OH)D} concentrations with all-cause and cause-specific mortality, with particular attention given to the shape of dose-response relations. Design: Concentrations of 25({OH)D} were measured in n = 9578 baseline and n = 5469 5-y follow-up participants of the {ESTHER} study, which is a German population-based cohort aged 50–74 y at baseline. Deaths were recorded during 9.5 y of follow-up (median). Restricted cubic splines were used to assess dose-response relations, and Cox regression with time-dependent variables was used to estimate hazard ratios. Results: During follow-up, 1083 study participants died; of those, 350 individuals died of cardiovascular diseases, 433 individuals died of cancer, and 55 individuals died of respiratory diseases. The overall mortality [{HR} (95\% {CI)]} of subjects with vitamin D deficiency [25({OH)D} concentrations {\textless}30 {nmol/L]} or vitamin D insufficiency [25({OH)D} concentrations from 30 to 50 {nmol/L)} was significantly increased [1.71 (1.43, 2.03) and 1.17 (1.02, 1.35), respectively] compared with that of subjects with sufficient 25({OH)D} concentrations ({\textgreater}50 {nmol/L)].} Vitamin D deficiency was also associated with increased cardiovascular mortality [1.39 (95\% {CI:} 1.02, 1.89)], cancer mortality [1.42 (95\% {CI:} 1.08, 1.88)] and respiratory disease mortality [2.50 (95\% {CI:} 1.12, 5.56)]. The association of 25({OH)D} concentrations with all-cause mortality proved to be a nonlinear inverse association with risk that started to increase at 25({OH)D} concentrations {\textless}75 {nmol/L.} Conclusions: In this large cohort study, serum 25({OH)D} concentrations were inversely associated with all-cause and cause-specific mortality. In particular, vitamin D deficiency [25({OH)D} concentration {\textless}30 {nmol/L]} was strongly associated with mortality from all causes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and respiratory diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider fitting categorical regression models to data obtained by either stratified or nonstratified case-control, or response selective, sampling from a finite population with known population totals in each response category. With certain models, such as the logistic with appropriate constant terms, a method variously known as conditional maximum likelihood (Breslow \& Cain, 1988) or pseudo-conditional likelihood (Wild, 1991), which involves the prospective fitting of a pseudo-model, results in maximum likelihood estimates of case-control data. We extend these results by showing the maximum likelihood estimates for any model can be found by iterating this process with a simple updating of offset parameters. Attention is also paid to estimation of the asymptotic covariance matrix. One benefit of the results of this paper is the ability to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of logistic models for stratified case-control studies, compare Breslow \& Cain (1988), Scott \& Wild (1991), using an ordinary logistic regression program, even when the stratum constants are modelled.},

  Abstract                 = {A case-cohort design was recently proposed [Prentice (1986)] as a means of reducing cost in large epidemiologic cohort studies. A "pseudolikelihood" procedure was described for relative risk regression parameter estimation. This procedure involves covariate data only on subjects who develop disease and on a random subset of the entire cohort. In contrast, the usual partial likelihood estimation procedure requires covariate histories on the entire cohort. Accordingly, a case-cohort design may affect cost saving, particularly with large cohorts and infrequent disease occurrence. Asymptotic distribution theory for such pseudolikelihood estimators, along with that for corresponding cumulative failure rate estimators, are presented here. Certain asymptotic efficiency expressions relative to full-cohort estimators are developed and tabulated in situations of relevance to the design of large-scale disease prevention trials. The theoretical developments make use of martingale convergence results and finite population convergence results.},

  Abstract                 = {Vitamin D deficiency is associated with osteoporosis, poor muscle strength, falls, and fractures. The relationship between serum vitamin D concentrations and mortality in older community-dwelling women has not been well characterized. We hypothesized that women with lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[{OH]D)} concentrations were at higher risk of mortality. We examined the association between serum 25[{OH]D} concentrations and all-cause mortality in a prospective, population-based study of 714 community-dwelling women, aged 70 to 79 years, the Women's Health and Aging Studies I and {II} in Baltimore, Md. The studies were originally designed to evaluate the causes and course of physical disability in older women living in the community. Vital status was determined through follow-up interviews and matching with the National Death Index. During a median of 72 months of follow-up, 100 (14\%) of 714 women died. Women in the lowest quartile of 25({OH)D} (\&lt;15.3 {ng/mL} or 38.2 {nmol/L)} were at higher risk of death (hazards ratio, 2.45; 95\% confidence interval, 1.12-5.36; P = .02) compared to women in the highest quartile (\&gt;27.0 {ng/mL} or 67.4 {nmol/L)} of 25({OH)D} in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for demographics, season, and conventional risk factors. Older community-dwelling women with low 25({OH)D} levels are at an increased risk of death.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: The aim of this study was to assess whether a history of asthma or the use of asthma medications is associated with prostate cancer risk. Methods: Of 16,934 men participating in the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, 1,179 were diagnosed with prostate cancer during an average follow-up of 13.4 years to the end of December 2007. Information on asthma history was obtained at baseline interview. Participants were asked to bring their current medications to the study center. The names of the drugs were entered into a form and coded. Asthma medications were categorized into four groups and corresponding hazard ratios ({HR)} were estimated from Cox regression models adjusted for country of birth. Results: Asthma was associated with a small increase in prostate cancer risk [{HR} 1.25; 95\% confidence interval (95\% {CI)}, 1.05-1.49]. The {HRs} for use of medications were 1.39 (95\% {CI}, 1.03-1.88) for inhaled glucocorticoids, 1.71 (95\% {CI}, 1.08-2.69) for systemic glucocorticoids, 1.36 (95\% {CI}, 1.05-1.76) for bronchodilators, and 0.78 (95\% {CI}, 0.45-1.35) for antihistamines. The {HRs} for asthma and asthma medication use changed only slightly after mutual adjustment. Conclusions: A history of asthma and the use of asthma medications, particularly systemic glucocorticoids, are associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, although it is difficult to disentangle the effects of asthma medications from those of asthma per se. Impact: These findings, if confirmed in independent studies, might lead to the identification of new risk factors for prostate cancer.

  Abstract                 = {Purpose Preliminary studies have identified pro–surfactant protein B (pro-{SFTPB)} to be a promising blood biomarker for non–small-cell lung cancer. We conducted a study to determine the independent predictive potential of pro-{SFTPB} in identifying individuals who are subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer. Patients and Methods Pro-{SFTPB} levels were measured in 2,485 individuals, who enrolled onto the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study by using plasma sample collected at the baseline visit. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the predictive ability of pro-{SFTPB} in addition to known lung cancer risk factors. Calibration and discrimination were evaluated, the latter by an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC).} External validation was performed with samples collected in the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial ({CARET)} participants using a case-control study design. Results Adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, personal history of cancer, family history of lung cancer, forced expiratory volume in one second percent predicted, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, and smoking duration, pro-{SFTPB} (log transformed) had an odds ratio of 2.220 (95\% {CI}, 1.727 to 2.853; P {\textless} .001). The {AUCs} of the full model with and without pro-{SFTPB} were 0.741 (95\% {CI}, 0.696 to 0.783) and 0.669 (95\% {CI}, 0.620 to 0.717; difference in {AUC} P {\textless} .001). In the {CARET} Study, the use of pro-{SFPTB} yielded an {AUC} of 0.683 (95\% {CI}, 0.604 to 0.761). Conclusion Pro-{SFTPB} in plasma is an independent predictor of lung cancer and may be a valuable addition to existing lung cancer risk prediction models.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Reliable risk prediction tools for estimating individual probability of lung cancer have important public health implications. We constructed and validated a comprehensive clinical tool for lung cancer risk prediction by smoking status. Methods Epidemiologic data from 1851 lung cancer patients and 2001 matched control subjects were randomly divided into separate training (75\% of the data) and validation (25\% of the data) sets for never, former, and current smokers, and multivariable models were constructed from the training sets. The discriminatory ability of the models was assessed in the validation sets by examining the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves and with concordance statistics. Absolute 1-year risks of lung cancer were computed using national incidence and mortality data. An ordinal risk index was constructed for each smoking status category by summing the odds ratios from the multivariable regression analyses for each risk factor. Results All variables that had a statistically significant association with lung cancer (environmental tobacco smoke, family history of cancer, dust exposure, prior respiratory disease, and smoking history variables) have strong biologically plausible etiologic roles in the disease. The concordance statistics in the validation sets for the never, former, and current smoker models were 0.57, 0.63, and 0.58, respectively. The computed 1-year absolute risk of lung cancer for a hypothetical male current smoker with an estimated relative risk close to 9 was 8.68\%. The ordinal risk index performed well in that true-positive rates in the designated high-risk categories were 69\% and 70\% for current and former smokers, respectively. Conclusions If confirmed in other studies, this risk assessment procedure could use easily obtained clinical information to identify individuals who may benefit from increased screening surveillance for lung cancer. Although the concordance statistics were modest, they are consistent with those from other risk prediction models.},

  Abstract                 = {Results from epidemiologic studies examining pancreatic cancer risk and vitamin D intake or 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25({OH)D)} concentrations (the best indicator of vitamin D derived from diet and sun) have been inconsistent. Therefore, the authors conducted a pooled nested case-control study of participants from 8 cohorts within the Cohort Consortium Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers ({VDPP)} (1974–2006) to evaluate whether prediagnostic circulating 25({OH)D} concentrations were associated with the development of pancreatic cancer. In total, 952 incident pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases occurred among participants (median follow-up, 6.5 years). Controls (n = 1,333) were matched to each case by cohort, age, sex, race/ethnicity, date of blood draw, and follow-up time. Conditional logistic regression analysis was used to calculate smoking-, body mass index-, and diabetes-adjusted odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals for pancreatic cancer. Clinically relevant 25({OH)D} cutpoints were compared with a referent category of 50–{\textless}75 {nmol/L.} No significant associations were observed for participants with lower 25({OH)D} status. However, a high 25({OH)D} concentration (≥100 {nmol/L)} was associated with a statistically significant 2-fold increase in pancreatic cancer risk overall (odds ratio = 2.12, 95\% confidence interval: 1.23, 3.64). Given this result, recommendations to increase vitamin D concentrations in healthy persons for the prevention of cancer should be carefully considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Nested case-control designs are inevitably less efficient than full cohort designs, and it is important to use available information as efficiently as possible. Reuse of controls by inverse probability weighting may be one way to obtain efficiency improvements, and it can be particularly advantageous when two or more endpoints are analyzed in the same cohort. The controls in a nested case-control design are often matched on additional factors than at risk status, and this should be taken into account when reusing controls. Although some studies have suggested methods for handling additional matching, a thorough investigation of how this affects parameter estimates and weights is lacking. Our aim is to provide such a discussion to help developing guidelines for practitioners. We demonstrate that it is important to adjust for the matching variables in regression analyses when the matching is broken. We present three types of estimators for the inverse sampling probabilities accounting for additional matching. One of these estimators was somewhat biased when the cases and controls were matched very closely. We investigated how additional matching affected estimates of interest, with varying degree of association between the matching variables and exposure/outcome. Strong associations introduced only a small bias when the matching variables were properly adjusted for. Sometimes, exposure variables, for example, blood samples, are analyzed in batches. Rather, strong batch effects had to be present before this introduced much bias when the matching was broken. All simulations are based on a study of prostate cancer and vitamin D.

However, in the last decade or so, methods have been developed that break the matching and allow for analyses where the controls are no longer tied to their cases. These methods can be divided into two groups; weighted partial likelihood ({WPL)} methods and full maximum likelihood methods. The weights in the {WPL} can be estimated in different ways and four estimation procedures are discussed. In addition, we address modifications needed to accommodate left truncation. A full likelihood approach is also presented and we suggest an aggregation technique to decrease the computation time. Furthermore, we generalize calibration for case-cohort designs to {NCC} studies. We consider a competing risks situation and compare {WPL}, full likelihood and calibration through simulations and analyses on a real data example.},

Thus, high 17β-E2 level may reflect presence of risk factors precipitating development of diseases. Low {25OHD} level predicted mortality more weakly, mainly for the first 3 years of the follow-up, and was strongly influenced by the confounding variables. Thus, low {25OHD} level may reflect poor current health status and unhealthy lifestyle.},

In this design, all cases are assembled together with a randomly selected sub-cohort which is then used as a comparison group, one advantage being that the same sub-cohort may serve as a comparison group for a number of different case series. However, the fact that all case groups are compared with the same sub-cohort creates a correlation between estimated effects of exposures on the different outcomes. This asymptotic correlation is derived using martingale central limit theory by studying competing risks data samples using a case-cohort design. In a Monte-Carlo simulation study, we study effects on the correlation of factors such as number of cases and size of sub-cohort.},

  Abstract                 = {Introduction Identification of individuals at high risk for lung cancer should be of value to individuals, patients, clinicians, and researchers. Existing prediction models have only modest capabilities to classify persons at risk accurately. Methods Prospective data from 70 962 control subjects in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial ({PLCO)} were used in models for the general population (model 1) and for a subcohort of ever-smokers (N = 38 254) (model 2). Both models included age, socioeconomic status (education), body mass index, family history of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, recent chest x-ray, smoking status (never, former, or current), pack-years smoked, and smoking duration. Model 2 also included smoking quit-time (time in years since ever-smokers permanently quit smoking). External validation was performed with 44 223 {PLCO} intervention arm participants who completed a supplemental questionnaire and were subsequently followed. Known available risk factors were included in logistic regression models. Bootstrap optimism-corrected estimates of predictive performance were calculated (internal validation). Nonlinear relationships for age, pack-years smoked, smoking duration, and quit-time were modeled using restricted cubic splines. All reported P values are two-sided. Results During follow-up (median 9.2 years) of the control arm subjects, 1040 lung cancers occurred. During follow-up of the external validation sample (median 3.0 years), 213 lung cancers occurred. For models 1 and 2, bootstrap optimism-corrected receiver operator characteristic area under the curves were 0.857 and 0.805, and calibration slopes (model-predicted probabilities vs observed probabilities) were 0.987 and 0.979, respectively. In the external validation sample, models 1 and 2 had area under the curves of 0.841 and 0.784, respectively. These models had high discrimination in women, men, whites, and nonwhites. Conclusion The {PLCO} lung cancer risk models demonstrate high discrimination and calibration.},

  Abstract                 = {Backgrounds: Multiple polymorphisms affecting smoking behavior have been identified through genome-wide association studies. Circulating levels of the nicotine metabolite cotinine is a marker of recent smoking exposure. Hence, genetic variants influencing smoking behavior are expected to be associated with cotinine levels. Methods: We conducted an analysis in a lung cancer case–control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition ({EPIC)} cohort. We investigated the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNP)} previously associated with smoking behavior on (i) circulating cotinine and (ii) lung cancer risk. A total of 894 cases and 1,805 controls were analyzed for cotinine and genotyped for 10 polymorphisms on 7p14, 8p11, 10q23, 15q25, and 19q13. Results: Two variants in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes {CHRNA5} and {CHRNA3} on 15q25, rs16969968 and rs578776, were associated with cotinine (P = 0.001 and 0.03, respectively) in current smokers and with lung cancer risk (P {\textless} 0.001 and P = 0.001, respectively). Two 19q13 variants, rs7937 and rs4105144, were associated with increased cotinine (P = 0.003 and P {\textless} 0.001, respectively) but decreased lung cancer risk (P = 0.01 for both, after adjusting for cotinine). Variants in 7p14, 8p11, and 10q23 were not associated with cotinine or lung cancer risk. Conclusions: 15q25 and 19q13 {SNPs} were associated with circulating cotinine. The directions of association for 15q25 variants with cotinine were in accordance with that expected of lung cancer risk, whereas {SNPs} on 19q13 displayed contrasting associations of cotinine and lung cancer that require further investigation. Impact: This study is the largest to date investigating the effects of polymorphisms affecting smoking behavior on lung cancer risk using circulating cotinine measures as proxies for recent smoking behavior.

  Abstract                 = {Background: Our objective was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies on colorectal cancer ({CRC)} and vitamin D intake and 25-hydroxyvitamin D status, as part of the World Cancer Research Fund Continuous Update Project. We also aimed at conducting meta-analysis of all studies on {CRC} and vitamin D receptor ({VDR)} single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Methods: Relevant studies were identified in {PubMed} (up to June 2010). Inclusion criteria were original and peer-reviewed publications with a prospective design (for studies on vitamin D intake or status). Random effects of dose-response meta-analyses were performed on cancer incidence. Results: We observed inverse associations of {CRC} risk with dietary vitamin D [summary relative risk ({RR)} per 100 {IU/day} = 0.95, 95\% {CI:} 0.93–0.98; 10 studies; range of intake (midpoints) = 39–719 {IU/day]} and serum/plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D ({RR} per 100 {IU/L} = 0.96, 0.94–0.97; 6 studies; range = 200–1,800 {IU/L)}, but not with total vitamin D (5 studies). Supplemental (2 studies; range = 0–600 {IU/day)} and total (4 studies; range = 79–732 {IU/day)} vitamin D intake and 25-hydroxyvitamin D status (6 studies; range = 200–1,800 {IU/L)} were inversely associated with colon cancer risk. We did not observe statistically significant associations between {FokI}, {PolyA}, {TaqI}, Cdx2, and {ApaI} {VDR} polymorphisms and {CRC} risk. The {BsmI} polymorphism was associated with a lower {CRC} risk ({RR} = 0.57, 0.36–0.89 for {BB} versus bb, 8 studies). Conclusions: These meta-analyses support the evidence of an inverse association between vitamin D intake, 25-hydroxyvitamin D status, and the {BsmI} {VDR} polymorphism and {CRC} risk.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD)} affects more than 200 million people worldwide and is expected to become the third leading cause of death in 2020. {COPD} is characterized by progressive airflow limitation, due to a combination of chronic inflammation and remodeling of the small airways (bronchiolitis) and loss of elastic recoil caused by destruction of the alveolar walls (emphysema). Lung cancer is the most important cause of cancer-related death in the world. (Cigarette) smoking is the principal culprit causing both {COPD} and lung cancer; in addition, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, biomass fuel smoke, coal smoke and outdoor air pollution have also been associated with an increased incidence of both diseases. Importantly, smokers with {COPD} – defined as either not fully reversible airflow limitation or emphysema – have a two- to four-fold increased risk to develop lung cancer. In this review, we highlight several of the genetic, epigenetic and inflammatory mechanisms, which link {COPD} and carcinogenesis in the lungs. Elucidating the biological pathways and networks, which underlie the increased susceptibility of lung cancer in patients with {COPD}, has important implications for screening, prevention, diagnosis and treatment of these two devastating pulmonary diseases.},

Methods The study population included 552 men and 584 women aged 53–73 years who were free of {CVD} and cancer at baseline in 1998–2001 from the prospective, population-based Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor ({KIHD)} Study. Deaths were ascertained by a computer linkage to the national cause of death register. All deaths that occurred from the study entry to December 31, 2008, were included. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the association between serum 25({OH)D} and risk of death. Results The mean serum 25({OH)D} concentration was 43.7 {nmol/L} ({SD} 17.8), with a strong seasonal variation. During the average follow-up of 9.1 years, 87 participants died, 35 from cardiovascular disease ({CVD).} After multivariable-adjustments, the hazard ratios ({HR)} for all cause death in the tertiles of serum 25({OH)D} were 1, 1.68 (95\% {CI:} 0.92, 3.07) and 2.06 (95\% {CI:} 1.12, 3.80), p for trend = 0.02. Conclusions Our study supports the accumulating evidence from epidemiological studies that vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased risk of death. Large-scale primary prevention trials with vitamin D supplementation are warranted.},

  Abstract                 = {Background A role for vitamin D in cancer risk reduction has been hypothesized, but few data exist for lung cancer. We investigated the relationship between vitamin D status, using circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25({OH)D]}, and lung cancer risk in a nested case-control study within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study of Finnish male smokers.
Methods Lung cancer cases (n = 500) were randomly selected based on month of blood collection, and 500 controls were matched to them based on age and blood collection date. Odds ratios ({ORs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs)} were calculated using multivariate-adjusted conditional logistic regression. To account for seasonal variation in 25({OH)D} concentrations, season-specific and season-standardized quintiles of 25({OH)D} were examined, and models were also stratified on season of blood collection (darker season = {November–April} and sunnier season = {May–October).} Pre-determined, clinically-defined cutpoints for 25({OH)D} and 25({OH)D} as a continuous measure were also examined.
Results Overall, 25({OH)D} was not associated with lung cancer. Risks were 1.08 (95\% {CI} 0.67–1.75) and 0.83 (95\% {CI} 0.53–1.31) in the highest vs. lowest season-specific and season-standardized quintiles of 25({OH)D}, respectively, and 0.91 (95\% {CI} 0.48–1.72) for the ≥75 vs. {\textless}25 {nmol/L} clinical categories. Inverse associations were, however, suggested for subjects with blood collections from {November–April}, with {ORs} of 0.77 (95\% {CI} 0.41–1.45, p-trend = 0.05) and 0.65 (95\% {CI} 0.37–1.14, p-trend = 0.07) in the highest vs. lowest season-specific and season-standardized quintiles of 25({OH)D}, respectively, and 0.61 (95\% {CI} 0.24–1.52, p-trend = 0.01) for ≥75 vs. {\textless}25 {nmol/L.} We also found 11\% lower risk for a 10 {nmol/L} increase in 25({OH)D} in the darker season based on the continuous measure ({OR} = 0.89, 95\% {CI} 0.81–0.98, p = 0.02).

We measured wintertime serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25({OH)D]} concentrations in 824 elderly people from 11 European countries. 36\% of men and 47\% of women had 25({OH)D} concentrations below 30 {nmol/L.} Users of vitamin D supplements and/or sunlamps had higher 25({OH)D} (median 54 {nmol/L)} than non users (median 31 {nmol/L).} Surprisingly, lowest mean 25({OH)D} concentrations were seen in southern European countries. Low 25({OH)D} concentrations could largely be explained by attitudes towards sunlight exposure and factors of physical health status, after exclusion of users of vitamin D supplements or sunlamps. Problems with daily living activities and wearing clothes with long sleeves during periods of sunshine were strong predictors of low wintertime serum 25({OH)D} concentrations. These findings show that free-living elderly Europeans, regardless of geographical location, are at substantial risk of inadequate vitamin D status during winter and that dietary enrichment or supplementation with vitamin D should be seriously considered during this season.},

Maximum likelihood estimation is developed and compared with two pseudo-likelihood approaches. The relative efficiencies of the methods are explored in the special case of estimating the parameters of the proportional odds model for ordinal responses. For such applications the method Hsieh, Manski \& {McFadden} (1985) call ‘conditional maximum likelihood’ is shown to be essentially as efficient as maximum likelihood; the latter is considerably more difficult to implement. In contrast the use of a weighted estimate of the prospective likelihood can lead to a substantial loss of efficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {Fish, vitamin D, flavonoids, and flavonoid-containing foods may have cardiovascular benefits and therefore may also reduce the risk of renal cell cancer. Risk was prospectively assessed in the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (1985–2002) cohort (N = 27,111; 15.2 mean person-years of follow-up). At enrollment, demographic, health, and dietary history information was recorded. Individuals who smoked less than 5 cigarettes/day, with chronic renal insufficiency or prior cancer, were excluded. Hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals from Cox regression were used to compare upper quartiles (quartiles 2–4) with the lowest quartile (quartile 1) of dietary intake. Among 228 cases, risk (quartile 4 vs. quartile 1) was associated with consumption of the flavonoid quercetin (hazard ratio = 0.6, 95\% confidence interval: 0.4, 0.9; Ptrend = 0.015) and Baltic herring (hazard ratio = 2.0, 95\% confidence interval: 1.4, 3.0; Ptrend {\textless} 0.001), with adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking, blood pressure, alcohol use, physical activity, urban residence, and education. In geographically stratified models, the risks associated with herring and total fish intake appeared to be highest in the urban coast region, although the interaction was not statistically significant. These results suggest that the flavonoid quercetin may prevent renal cell cancer among male smokers. The possible risk associated with fish intake warrants further investigation before conclusions may be drawn.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been estimated by various authorities that about one-third of cancers in Western high-income societies are attributable to factors relating to food, nutrition and physical activity. Identifying with confidence specific associations between dietary patterns, foods, body composition or individual nutrients is not simple because of the long latent period for cancer development, its complex pathogenesis and the challenge of characterising the multidimensional aspects of diet and activity over a lifetime. Reliable conclusions must therefore be drawn not only from randomised controlled trials but from a variety of methodological approaches, judged within a classic framework for inferring causality. Using a newly-developed method with a protocol for standardising the literature search and for analysis and display of the evidence, nine independent academic centres have conducted systematic reviews addressing the causal associations between food, nutrition and physical activity and risk of development of seventeen cancers, as well as of weight gain and obesity. A review has also examined the efficacy of such interventions in subjects with cancer. The reviews have been assessed by an independent Panel of twenty-one international experts who drew conclusions with grades of confidence in the causality of associations and made recommendations. Recommendations are given as public health goals as well as for individuals.},

Materials and Methods Fresh-frozen primary tumor and peritumor tissues from 27 patients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma were analyzed for {TRPV5/6} and vitamin D receptor expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that {TRPV5/6} and vitamin D receptor expression was decreased 38.11, 4.44 and 3.20 times in renal cell carcinoma vs normal kidney tissue (p = 0.012, 0.002 and 0.020, respectively). Relatively higher expression was noted for chromophobe renal cell carcinoma than for the other renal cell carcinoma subtypes. Vitamin D receptor {mRNA} expression significantly correlated with that of {TRPV6} (r = 0.508, p = 0.007) and {TRPV5} (r = 0.697, p = 0.032) in renal cell carcinoma. Western blot showed results similar to those of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Different expression was detected between kidney and renal cell carcinoma tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis verified strong detection of {TRPV5/6} and vitamin D receptor in distal nephrons but demonstrated weak or no immunostaining much more often in renal cell carcinoma. Conclusions Decreased {TRPV5/V6} expression was noted in renal cell carcinoma, which correlated with vitamin D receptor. Different expression was also detected among the different renal cell carcinoma histopathological subtypes. Our observations suggest that altered vitamin D receptor expression may be associated with renal cell carcinoma carcinogenesis via {TRPV5/6.}},

  Abstract                 = {{SummaryBackground} Alcohol is an important determinant of the high and fluctuating adult mortality rates in Russia, but cause-specific detail is lacking. Our case–control study investigated the effects of alcohol consumption on male and female cause-specific mortality. Methods In three Russian industrial cities with typical 1990s mortality patterns (Tomsk, Barnaul, Biysk), the addresses of 60 416 residents who had died at ages 15–74 years in 1990–2001 were visited in 2001–05. Family members were present for 50 066 decedents; for 48 557 (97\%), the family gave proxy information on the decedents' past alcohol use and on potentially confounding factors. Cases (n=43 082) were those certified as dying from causes we judged beforehand might be substantially affected by alcohol or tobacco; controls were the other 5475 decedents. Case versus control relative risks ({RRs;} calculated as odds ratios by confounder-adjusted logistic regression) were calculated in ever-drinkers, defining the reference category by two criteria: usual weekly consumption always less than 0·5 half-litre bottles of vodka (or equivalent in total alcohol content) and maximum consumption of spirits in 1 day always less than 0·5 half-litre bottles. Other ever-drinkers were classified by usual weekly consumption into three categories: less than one, one to less than three, and three or more (mean 5·4 [{SD} 1·4]) bottles of vodka or equivalent. Findings In men, the three causes accounting for the most alcohol-associated deaths were accidents and violence ({RR} 5·94, 95\% {CI} 5·35–6·59, in the highest consumption category), alcohol poisoning (21·68, 17·94–26·20), and acute ischaemic heart disease other than myocardial infarction (3·04, 2·73–3·39), which includes some misclassified alcohol poisoning. There were significant excesses of upper aerodigestive tract cancer (3·48, 2·84–4·27) and liver cancer (2·11, 1·64–2·70). Another five disease groups had {RRs} of more than 3·00 in the highest alcohol category: tuberculosis (4·14, 3·44–4·98), pneumonia (3·29, 2·83–3·83), liver disease (6·21, 5·16–7·47), pancreatic disease (6·69, 4·98–9·00), and ill-specified conditions (7·74, 6·48–9·25). Although drinking was less common in women, the {RRs} associated with it were generally more extreme. After correction for reporting errors, alcohol-associated excesses accounted for 52\% of all study deaths at ages 15–54 years (men 8182 [59\%] of 13968, women 1565 [33\%] of 4751) and 18\% of those at 55–74 years (men 3944 [22\%] of 17 536, women 1493 [12\%] of 12 302). Allowance for under-representation of extreme drinkers would further increase alcohol-associated proportions. Large fluctuations in mortality from these ten strongly alcohol-associated causes were the main determinants of recent fluctuations in overall mortality in the study region and in Russia as a whole. Interpretation Alcohol-attributable mortality varies by year; in several recent years, alcohol was a cause of more than half of all Russian deaths at ages 15–54 years. Alcohol accounts for most of the large fluctuations in Russian mortality, and alcohol and tobacco account for the large difference in adult mortality between Russia and western Europe.

  Abstract                 = {A nested case-control study, including 830 cases and 992 controls from 7 cohorts, was conducted to evaluate the association of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25({OH)D)}, the best indicator of vitamin D status, with risk of endometrial cancer. Matching factors included age at blood donation, date of blood donation, and race. Conditional logistic regression was used in the main analysis. The median concentration of 25({OH)D} was slightly lower in cases (49.4 {nmol/L)} than in controls (50.8 {nmol/L)} (P = 0.08). However, there was no association between 25({OH)D} concentration and disease risk, after adjustment for body mass index. Compared with the 50–{\textless}75 {nmol/L} 25({OH)D} category, the body mass index-adjusted odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were 1.08 (95\% confidence interval: 0.73, 1.57) for the {\textless}25 {nmol/L} category and 0.90 (95\% confidence interval: 0.51, 1.58) for the ≥100 {nmol/L} category (Ptrend = 0.99). Similarly null results were observed after further adjustment for other known risk factors and in stratified analyses. Although an effect of circulating 25({OH)D} at high concentrations cannot be ruled out (the highest category of 25({OH)D} was ≥100 {nmol/L}, and for stratified analyses, ≥75 {nmol/L)}, these results do not support a protective role of vitamin D against endometrial cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {A role for vitamin D in ovarian cancer etiology is supported by ecologic studies of sunlight exposure, experimental mechanism studies, and some studies of dietary vitamin D intake and genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D receptor. However, few studies have examined the association of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25({OH)D)}, an integrated measure of vitamin D status, with ovarian cancer risk. A nested case-control study was conducted among 7 prospective studies to evaluate the circulating 25({OH)D} concentration in relation to epithelial ovarian cancer risk. Logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals among 516 cases and 770 matched controls. Compared with 25({OH)D} concentrations of 50–{\textless}75 {nmol/L}, no statistically significant associations were observed for {\textless}37.5 (odds ratio ({OR)} = 1.21, 95\% confidence interval ({CI):} 0.87, 1.70), 37.5–{\textless}50 ({OR} = 1.03, 95\% {CI:} 0.75, 1.41), or ≥75 ({OR} = 1.11, 95\% {CI:} 0.79, 1.55) {nmol/L.} Analyses stratified by tumor subtype, age, body mass index, and other variables were generally null but suggested an inverse association between 25({OH)D} and ovarian cancer risk among women with a body mass index of ≥25 kg/m2 (Pinteraction {\textless} 0.01). In conclusion, this large pooled analysis did not support an overall association between circulating 25({OH)D} and ovarian cancer risk, except possibly among overweight women.},

  Abstract                 = {Two-phase study methods, in which more detailed or more expensive exposure information is only collected on a sample of individuals with events and a small proportion of other individuals, are expected to play a critical role in biomarker validation research. One major limitation of standard two-phase designs is that they are most conveniently employed with study cohorts in which information on longitudinal follow-up and other potential matching variables is electronically recorded. However for many practical situations, at the sampling stage such information may not be readily available for every potential candidates. Study eligibility needs to be verified by reviewing information from medical charts one by one. In this manuscript, we study in depth a novel study design commonly undertaken in practice that involves sampling until quotas of eligible cases and controls are identified. We propose semiparametric methods to calculate risk distributions and a wide variety of prediction indices when outcomes are censored failure times and data are collected under the quota sampling design. Consistency and asymptotic normality of our estimators are established using empirical process theory. Simulation results indicate that the proposed procedures perform well in finite samples. Application is made to the evaluation of a new risk model for predicting the onset of cardiovascular disease.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Accurate risk prediction plays a key role in disease prevention and disease management; emergence of new biomarkers may lead to an important question about how much improvement in prediction accuracy it would achieve by adding the new markers into the existing risk prediction tools. Purpose In large prospective cohort studies, the standard full-cohort design, requiring marker measurement on the entire cohort, may be infeasible due to cost and low rate of the clinical condition of interest. To overcome such difficulties, nested case–control ({NCC)} studies provide cost-effective alternatives but bring about challenges in statistical analyses due to complex data sets generated. Methods To evaluate prognostic accuracy of a risk model, Cai and Zheng proposed a class of nonparametric inverse probability weighting ({IPW)} estimators for accuracy measures in the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. To accommodate a three-phase {NCC} design in Nurses’ Health Study, we extend the double {IPW} estimators of Cai and Zheng to develop risk prediction models under time-dependent generalized linear models and evaluate the incremental values of new biomarkers and genetic markers. Results Our results suggest that aggregating the information from both the genetic markers and biomarkers substantially improves the accuracy for predicting 5-year and 10-year risks of rheumatoid arthritis. Conclusions Our method provided robust procedures to evaluate the incremental value of new biomarkers allowing for complex sampling designs.},

  Abstract                 = {Inhibitory effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on the growth of the renal carcinoma cell line. We studied the effect of vitamin D compounds on the growth of the human renal carcinoma cell line ({KU-2)} and discovered a receptor protein specific for the active form of vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The {KU-2} cell line was established from a pulmonary metastasis of renal cell carcinoma in a patient with hyperhemoglobinemia. The cells were tumorigenic in nude mice and clonogenic in a soft agar culture. Vitamin D3 derivatives suppressed proliferation of {KU-2} cells in a monolayer culture and also clonogenicity in a soft agar culture dose-dependently. Of the vitamin D3 derivatives tested, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was the most potent in inhibiting cell growth, followed successively by {1,24R},25-trihydroxyvitamin D3, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1-hydroxyvitamin D3 and {24R},25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in that order. Analysis of the cell cycle phase of treated and non-treated {KU-2} cells revealed that the action of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was not phase–specific but simply extended the doubling time of the cells. Radioreceptor assay and sucrose density gradient analysis of the cytosol showed that {KU-2} cells contained a {3.2S} receptor protein to which 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 was specifically bound (Kd = 20.8 4.8 {pM}, Nmax = 87 24 fmole/mg protein, 4000 molecules/cell). On the other hand, the equilibrium dissociation constant of internalization of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Kint) by intact {KU-2} cells was 1.2 {nM} and the internalizing capacity was 33 fmole/8 106 cells (2500 molecules/cell) in the 10\% serum medium, which was the same as that used in the growth study. This Kint value was very close to the half-maximal dose in growth inhibition. Also the affinity of various vitamin D3 derivatives for binding to the cytosol receptor in the {KU-2} cells was closely related to the ability to inhibit growth of the cells. These results indicate that the actions of vitamin D3 derivatives in inhibiting proliferation and clonogenicity of {KU-2} cells are affected by a receptor-mediated mechanism, and that the active form of vitamin D3 may be one of the regulatory factors affecting the proliferation and other biological functions of renal carcinoma cells.},
