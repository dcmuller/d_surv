\noindent \textbf{Background:} We assessed whether concentrations of vitamin D 
at diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is associated with prognosis.  
\newline 
\textbf{Methods:} We conducted a case-cohort study of 630 RCC cases from a 
multi-centre case-control study in eastern Europe. Vitamin D was assessed as 
25-Hydroxyvitamin D$_3$ [25(OH)D$_3$]. We used weighted Cox models to estimate 
hazard ratios (HR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) by categories of 
season-adjusted 25(OH)D$_3$.\newline 
\textbf{Results:} Higher concentrations of 25(OH)D$_3$ 
were associated with lower risk of death after adjusting for stage, age, sex, 
and country (HR highest versus lowest category 0.57, 95\% CI [0.34, 0.97]). 
This association did not vary by cause of death, though there was a suggestion 
that it might be stronger for those diagnosed with early stage disease. 
\newline 
\textbf{Conclusions:} 25(OH)D$_3$ concentration at diagnosis 
of RCC is inversely associated with risk of death. \newline

\section*{Introduction}
More than 300,000 kidney cancer cases are diagnosed yearly worldwide leading to 
approximately 130,000 deaths \cite{ferlay_cancer_2013}. The prognosis is 
strongly dependent on stage at diagnosis, with around 90\% of stage I patients 
alive five years after diagnosis, comparted with only 10\% of stage IV patients 
\cite{CRUK_kidney_2014}.

Little is known about factors influencing survival after diagnosis of kidney 
cancer, apart from tumor stage and grade. We recently investigated circulating 
vitamin D and kidney cancer onset and survival in a prospective epidemiological 
cohort where blood samples were collected at entry to the cohort, an average 
of 7 years before diagnosis [Muller et al., in press]. We reported an inverse 
association between vitamin D concentrations and risk of subsequent kidney 
cancer, and an increased rate of death after kidney cancer diagnosis for both 
low and high concentrations of vitamin D. Available data did not allow thorough 
analysis of cause-specific mortality, nor were we able to adjust for stage. This 
observation prompted us to investigate whether vitamin D concentrations at  
diagnosis of kidney cancer are associated with subsequent survival, independent 
of stage or other prognostic factors.

\section*{Methods}
\subsection*{The K2 study}
Participants included patients who were above 18 years of age and diagnosed 
with kidney cancer in one of 6 participating centres in Czech Republic (4 
centres), Romania (Bucharest), and Russia (Moscow). After obtaining informed 
consent, participants were given a standardized face-to-face lifestyle 
questionnaire covering socio-demographic characteristics, anthropometric 
measures, medical history, family history, and tobacco and alcohol use. 
Clinical and pathological data were abstracted from medical charts and 
pathological reports. A majority of participants underwent nephrectomy and the 
tumor was histologically confirmed. Follow-up for outcome (relapse, vital 
status, and cause of death where relevant) was performed every 6 to 12 months 
after diagnosis, using passive follow-up methods where possible and active 
follow-up methods when no linkage to databases was possible.

\subsection*{Case-cohort sampling}
Among 2330 participants with questionnaire data available and a diagnosis of 
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) according to ICDO-3, we excluded 125 participants 
with no plasma sample available, 1005 participants with no follow-up data at 
the time of this project, 5 participants with inconsistencies in reference 
dates, and 7 participants with no information on stage. From the 1188 
remaining, we randomly selected 500 participants at baseline (the subcohort). 
We also included all participants who died during follow-up that were not 
randomly selected in to the subcohort ($N=93$), as well as 37 stage IV patients 
that had survived and were not randomly selected, hence a total of 
630 participants for laboratory analysis. Of these, one participant ended up 
being classified as spindle cell sarcoma.

\subsection*{Biosample processing and biochemical analysis}
Venous blood was obtained before or at the time of the nephrectomy, prior to 
any treatment. Blood was collected in vacutainers containing 
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and processed as rapidly as possible 
(usually within two hours) to temporary store plasma samples at -80C in all 
centers, except in Ceske Budejovice where samples were stored at -20C. Samples 
were transported at -80C to IARC for central storage at -150C. Samples 
underwent a single thawing cycle for aliquoting of 400uL for shipment at -80C 
to the laboratory for analysis. Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem 
mass spectrometry was used to separately analyse vitamin D as 25(OH)D$_2$ and 
25(OH)D$_3$ \cite{midttun_determination_2011}. 25(OH)D$_2$ was undetectable in 
the majority of samples, so our analyses focus on 25(OH)D$_3$. The lab is DEQAS 
(www.deqas.org) certified.

\subsection*{Statistical analysis}
To adjust for seasonal variation, we modeled the expected log$_2$ 25(OH)D$_3$ 
concentration as a periodic function of day of blood draw using a pair of sine 
and cosine functions. To create season-adjusted categories, we grouped the 
residuals from this model at quartiles of their distribution among the randomly 
selected subcohort. We used Cox proportional hazards models with time since 
diagnosis (recruitment) as the time scale to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 
95\% confidence intervals (CI) for all-cause mortality by the season-adjusted 
categories of 25(OH)D$_3$. We also modeled 25(OH)D$_3$ continuously using 
restricted cubic splines with knots at its 10th, 33rd, 67th, and 90th 
percentiles, explicitly adjusting for seasonality by including the pair of sine 
and cosine functions. HRs for cause-specific mortality were calculated in a 
competing risks model using the data augmentation method 
\cite{lunn_applying_1995}. To account for the case-cohort design 
\cite{prentice_case-cohort_1986}, we used Barlow's method to weight the 
likelihood and computed robust variance estimates \cite{barlow_robust_1994, 
barlow_analysis_1999}. We investigated potential effect modification by fitting 
interactions between season-adjusted log$_2$ 25(OH)D$_3$ and various factors. 
All models included stage, age at recruitment, and sex as covariates, with the 
baseline hazard stratified by country of recruitment. We additionally adjusted 
for body mass index (BMI, kg/m$^2$), smoking status (never, former, current), 
and alcohol drinking status (never, former, current).
All $p$-values are two sided, and were calculated using the Wald test. 
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12.1 for Linux (Stata 
Corporation, College Station, Texas, US) and R version 3.1.1 \cite{r_2014}.

\section*{Results}
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample by vital status at 
the end of follow-up are presented in Table~1. The sample included a higher 
proportion of men (63\%) than women, and was predominantly recruited from the 
Czech Republic (52\%) and Russia (43\%), with only 5\% or participants 
recruited in Romania. Those participants who survived to the end of follow-up 
had a similar age distribution to those who died during follow-up. 518 
of the 630 cases (82\%) were conventional RCC. 50\% of deaths occurred among 
participants with a stage IV tumor, and 15\% of those surviving to the end of 
follow-up had stage IV diagnoses. In contrast, 72 \% of those surviving to the 
end of follow-up were diagnosed with stage I-II disease.

Hazard of death from any cause was inversely associated with 
circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D$_3$ (Table~2). After adjusting for 
stage, age, and sex, the hazard was 43\% lower among those in the highest 
compared to the lowest group of seasonally-adjusted concentration 
(HR$_{4\text{vs}1}$ 0.57, 95\% CI [0.34, 0.97]). A competing risks analysis 
found no evidence of heterogeneity by cause of death, suggesting that this 
association was not specific to deaths from RCC (Table~2). The HR for 
continuously varying 25(OH)D$_3$ (relative to a concentration of 50 nmol/L) is 
presented in Figure~1. These estimates corroborate those in Table~2, suggesting 
a monotonic inverse association between 25(OH)D$_3$ and hazard of death.

Figure~2 presents HRs for a doubling in seasonally adjusted 25(OH)D$_3$ 
concentration separately by categories of several potential effect modifiers. 
The estimated magnitude of the association was consistent by, sex, stage, 
histology, history of diabetes, smoking status, and alcohol intake status. 
There was some indication that the association might be stronger among those 
diagnosed at age 65 years or older, those with a history of hypertension, those 
with higher BMI, or those diagnosed with stage I or II RCC, but there was 
little statistical evidence of interaction with any of these factors.

\section*{Discussion}
We investigated whether differences in circulating concentrations of 
25(OH)D$_3$ at the time of diagnosis of RCC were associated with all-cause and 
cause-specific survival. We observed that higher concentrations of 25(OH)D$_3$ 
were associated with a lower rate of death, and that the 
association was not restricted to RCC specific death. We also observed an 
indication that the strength of this association might vary by other factors.
Most notably the association appeared somewhat stronger for those with a 
history of hypertension, advanced age at diagosis, or eary stage disease.

This investigation was motivated by our recent study of circulating 25(OH)D$_3$ 
and risk of RCC in the prospective EPIC cohort [Muller et al., in press], in 
which we observed an inverse association between 25(OH)D$_3$ and risk of RCC. 
Pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D$_3$ was also associated with post RCC mortality, with 
both low and high concentrations associated with an increased rate of death 
among RCC cases. The results from the present study are not completely 
consistent with these initial findings. We found no evidence of increased rate 
of death among patients with high 25(OH)D$_3$ at diagnosis, but rather an 
inverse association between 25(OH)D$_3$ and all-cause mortality across the 
range of observed concentrations.

There is a large literature regarding circulating vitamin D and all-cause 
mortality in general populations. Consistent with our observation, many studies 
have reported high risk of death for people with low concentrations 
\cite{schottker_strong_2013, virtanen_association_2011, hutchinson_low_2010, 
szulc_serum_2009, semba_low_2009, pilz_vitamin_2009, 
melamed_ml_25-hydroxyvitamin_2008, jia_nutritional_2007}, suggesting that 
the association observed in our study might reflect a general phenomenon rather 
than something specific to RCC prognosis. This would be consistent with our 
observation that any association might be stronger among those patients 
diagnosed with early rather than advanced stage tumours. The lack of 
heterogeneity by cause of death provides additional indirect evidence that the 
association between vitamin D and mortality is unlikely to exist exclusively 
among RCC patients. 

In summary, we found that high 25(OH)D$_3$ at diagnosis of RCC was associated 
with lower risk of death. This association was not restricted to RCC 
cause-specific death, and appeared stronger for early stage disease, suggesting 
that it might reflect a more general phenomenon rather than something 
specific to post RCC survival.
