%% continuously varying HR

\caption{Hazard ratio for all cause mortality among RCC cases as a function of 
circulating concentration of 25(OH)D$_3$ at diagnosis, relative to a 
concentration of 50~nmol/L. 25(OH)D$_3$ was modeled using restricted cubic 
splines with knots at the 10th, 33rd, 67th, and 90th percentiles of its 
distribution. Estimates were derived from a Cox model stratified by country of 
recruitment, and adjusted for stage, age at recruitment, and sex. Solid and 
dashed lines represent the maximum pseudolikelihood estimates and 95\% 
confidence intervals respectively. The translucent lines are 1000 draws from 
the multivariate normal distribution defined by the maximum pseudolikelihood 
estimates and their variance covariance matrix, and thus give an indication of 
the posterior density for the hazard ratio under a uniform prior on the 
regression coefficients. The ``rug plot'' shows the observed distribution of 
25(OH)D$_3$.}
